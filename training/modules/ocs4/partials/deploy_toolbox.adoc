=== Using the Rook-Ceph toolbox to check on the Ceph backing storage

Since the Rook-Ceph *toolbox* is not shipped with OCS, we need to deploy it
manually.

You can patch the `OCSInitialization ocsinit` using the following command line:

[source,role="execute"]
----
oc patch OCSInitialization ocsinit -n openshift-storage --type json --patch  '[{ "op": "replace", "path": "/spec/enableCephTools", "value": true }]'
----
