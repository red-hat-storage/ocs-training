OADP (OpenShift APIs for Data Protection) is a community operator and is available in *OperatorHub*. 

We will be using OADP for the `Backup` and `Restore` APIs for collecting the Kubernetes objects at a namespace level. The collection or backup of resources is needed to restore the application on the *secondary cluster*.

=== Installing OADP Operator

First is to find OADP in *OperatorHub*. Login to your *OpenShift Web Console* and navigate to *OperatorHub*. Filter for `OADP` as shown below:

.OperatorHub filter for OADP

NOTE: If you are not finding OADP in *OperatorHub* most likely the `community-operator` catalogsource is not deployed in your cluster.

Select `Continue` on next screen.

CAUTION: OADP is a community operator and as such is not supported by Red Hat. More information can be found at https://github.com/konveyor/oadp-operator.

Select `Install` on next screen.

Now you will create the new namespace `oadp-operator` and install the OADP operator into this namespace. Select `Install` again.

Wait for operator to install. When you see this screen the OADP operator is installed.

The next step is to create the `Velero` *CustomResource* or CR. For this you will need to have a `S3` compatible object bucket created that you know the `bucket name` as well as the credentials to access the bucket.

NOTE: It is not recommended to use OCS object buckets (MCG or RGW) as the `S3` *BackingStorageLocation* for `Velero` CR. If your remote or secondary clusters become unavailable and the `S3` bucket is created on that cluster there is no way to recover to alternate cluster.

=== Creating S3 Target Bucket Credentials Secret

Before creating the  `Velero` CR you must create the `cloud-credentials` file with the creditials for your `S3` bucket. The format of the file needs to be this:

----
[default]
aws_access_key_id=VELERO_ACCESS_KEY_ID
aws_secret_access_key=VELERO_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
----

Copy your unique credentials into file `cloud-credentials` and save file.

Now use this new `cloud-credentials` file to create a new *Secret*. Replace `<CREDENTIALS_FILE_PATH>` with path to file you created with `S3` credentials.

----
oc create secret generic cloud-credentials --namespace oadp-operator --from-file cloud=<CREDENTIALS_FILE_PATH>/cloud-credentials
----

=== Configuring Velero S3 Target

The `velero` configuration needs to be modified so it can use your `S3` bucket. The example is for a `S3` bucket on *AWS* saved as file `velero-aws.yaml`. It is recommended to use an object bucket `off-platform` meaning not backed by storage in the *primary cluster* (OCP-A) or the *secondary cluster* (OCP-DR).

NOTE: Your `velero` YAML file will be slightly different if using a `S3` object bucket from a different provider (GCP, Azure), from an external Ceph cluster with `RGW`, or from ODF `MCG`.

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: konveyor.openshift.io/v1alpha1
kind: Velero
metadata:
  name: oadp-velero
  namespace: oadp-operator
spec:
  olm_managed: true
  backup_storage_locations:
    - config:
        profile: default
        region: us-east-2  # <-- Modify to bucket AWS region or region for your provider
      credentials_secret_ref:
        name: cloud-credentials
        namespace: oadp-operator
      name: default
      object_storage:
        bucket: oadp-xxxxxx # Modify to your bucket name
        prefix: velero
      provider: aws
  default_velero_plugins:
    - aws
    - openshift
  enable_restic: false
----

Once you have your unique values copied into your YAML file create the `Velero` CR.

NOTE: If using a `MCG` object bucket instead of a bucket `off-platform` (i.e. AWS) as recommended, reference these https://github.com/konveyor/oadp-operator/blob/master/docs/noobaa/install_oadp_noobaa.md[instructions].

----
oc create -f velero-aws.yaml -n oadp-operator
----

Validate that the `velero` pod is `Running` and that the *BackingStorageLocation* have been created as well that has the details to access your `S3` bucket for Kubernetes object storage.

[source,role="execute"]
----
oc get pods,backupstoragelocation -n oadp-operator
----
.Example output:
----
NAME                                           READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE

pod/velero-6c6fd6d84d-mbct9                    1/1     Running   0          5m3s

NAME                                      PHASE       LAST VALIDATED   AGE
backupstoragelocation.velero.io/default   Available   9s               5m1s
----

IMPORTANT: Repeat these steps and install *OADP* on the *secondary cluster* (OCP-DR). Make sure to use the same `S3` bucket and credentials as for the *primary cluster* (OCP-A) when creating the `Velero` CR.
