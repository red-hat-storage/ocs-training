== Overview

OpenShift Data Foundation works in conjunction
with the https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.9/storage/persistent_storage/persistent-storage-local.html[Local Storage Operator] to use disks and devices on AWS EC2, VMware, Azure, Bare Metal hosts, etc. 

These instructions require that you have the ability to install version 4.9 for both ODF and the Local Storage Operator (LSO).

== Installing the Local Storage Operator

First, you will need to create a namespace for the Local Storage
Operator. A self descriptive `openshift-local-storage` namespace is recommended.

[source]
....
cat <<EOF | oc apply -f -
apiVersion: v1
kind: Namespace
metadata:
  name: openshift-local-storage
spec: {}
EOF
....

Create Operator Group for Local Storage Operator.

[source]
....
cat <<EOF | oc apply -f -
apiVersion: operators.coreos.com/v1
kind: OperatorGroup
metadata:
  name: local-operator-group
  namespace: openshift-local-storage
spec:
  targetNamespaces:
  - openshift-local-storage
EOF
....

Subscribe to Local Storage Operator and create the operator *Pod*.

[source]
....
cat <<EOF | oc apply -f -
apiVersion: operators.coreos.com/v1alpha1
kind: Subscription
metadata:
  name: local-storage-operator
  namespace: openshift-local-storage
spec:
  channel: "stable"
  installPlanApproval: Automatic
  name: local-storage-operator
  source: redhat-operators
  sourceNamespace: openshift-marketplace
EOF
....

=== Preparing Nodes

You will need to add the `ODF label` to each OCP node that has storage devices used to create the ODF storage cluster. The ODF operator looks for this label to know which nodes can be scheduling targets for ODF components. Later we will configure Local Storage Operator `Custom Resources` to create *PVs* from storage devices on nodes with this label. You must have a minimum of three labeled nodes with the same number of devices or disks with similar performance capability. SSDs or NVMe devices are highly recommended to create the ODF storage cluster.

To label the nodes use the following command:

[source,shell]
....
oc label node <NodeName> cluster.ocs.openshift.io/openshift-storage=''
....

CAUTION: Make sure to label OCP nodes in 3 different AWS availability zones if ODF installation is on AWS.

=== Auto Discovering Devices and creating Persistent Volumes

Local Storage Operator (LSO 4.6+) supports discovery of devices on OCP nodes with the label `cluster.ocs.openshift.io/openshift-storage=""`. Create the `LocalVolumeDiscovery` resource using this file after the OCP nodes are labeled with the `ODF label`.

[source]
....
cat <<EOF | oc apply -f -
apiVersion: local.storage.openshift.io/v1alpha1
kind: LocalVolumeDiscovery
metadata:
  name: auto-discover-devices
  namespace: openshift-local-storage
spec:
  nodeSelector:
    nodeSelectorTerms:
      - matchExpressions:
        - key: cluster.ocs.openshift.io/openshift-storage
          operator: Exists
EOF
....

After this resource is created you should see a new `localvolumediscoveries` resource and there will be a `localvolumediscoveryresults` for each OCP node labeled with the `ODF label`. Each `localvolumediscoveryresults` will have the detail for each disk on the node including the `by-id`, size and type of disk.

==== Create LocalVolumeSet

The disk are recommended to be SSDs or NVMe disks and must be raw block devices. This is due to the fact that the operator creates distinct partitions on the provided raw block devices for the metadata and data.

Use this file `localvolumeset.yaml` to create the `LocalVolumeSet`. Configure the parameters with comments to meet the needs of your environment.

[source]
....
apiVersion: local.storage.openshift.io/v1alpha1
kind: LocalVolumeSet
metadata:
  name: local-block
  namespace: openshift-local-storage
spec:
  nodeSelector:
    nodeSelectorTerms:
      - matchExpressions:
          - key: cluster.ocs.openshift.io/openshift-storage
            operator: In
            values:
              - ""
  storageClassName: localblock
  volumeMode: Block
  fsType: ext4
  maxDeviceCount: 1  # <-- Maximum number of devices per node to be used
  deviceInclusionSpec:
    deviceTypes:
    - disk
    - part   # <-- Remove this if not using partitions
    deviceMechanicalProperties:
    - NonRotational   # <-- For HDD change to Rotational
    #minSize: 0Ti   # <-- Uncomment and modify to limit the minimum size of disk used
    #maxSize: 0Ti   # <-- Uncomment and modify to limit the maximum size of disk used
....

[source,shell]
....
oc create -f localvolumeset.yaml
....

After the `localvolumesets` resource is created check that `Available` *PVs* are created for each disk on OCP nodes with the `ODF label`. It can take a few minutes until all disks appear as *PVs* while the Local Storage Operator is preparing the disks.

== Installing OpenShift Data Foundation

These instructions are used after ODF is generally available (GA). If you have a need to install pre-release ODF different instructions are required as well as access to pre-release entitled registries.

=== Install Operator

Create `openshift-storage` namespace.

[source]
....
cat <<EOF | oc apply -f -
apiVersion: v1
kind: Namespace
metadata:
  labels:
    openshift.io/cluster-monitoring: "true"
  name: openshift-storage
spec: {}
EOF
....

Create Operator Group for ODF Operator.

[source]
....
cat <<EOF | oc apply -f -
apiVersion: operators.coreos.com/v1
kind: OperatorGroup
metadata:
  name: openshift-storage-operatorgroup
  namespace: openshift-storage
spec:
  targetNamespaces:
  - openshift-storage
EOF
....

Subscribe to ODF Operator.

[source]
....
cat <<EOF | oc apply -f -
apiVersion: operators.coreos.com/v1alpha1
kind: Subscription
metadata:
  name: odf-operator
  namespace: openshift-storage
spec:
  channel: "stable-4.11"
  installPlanApproval: Automatic
  name: odf-operator
  source: redhat-operators
  sourceNamespace: openshift-marketplace
EOF
....

After the operator *Pods* are `Running` in the `openshift-storage` project, the next step is to enable the console plugin. Execute the following command:

[source]
....
oc patch console.operator cluster -n openshift-storage --type json -p '[{"op": "add", "path": "/spec/plugins", "value": ["odf-console"]}]'
....

=== Create Cluster

Reference https://github.com/red-hat-storage/ocs-operator/blob/main/deploy/csv-templates/crds/ocs/ocs.openshift.io_storageclusters.yaml[here] for more *StorageCluster* options. 

Under the `managedResources` section is the default setting of `manage` for ODF services (i.e., block, file, object using RGW, object using NooBaa). This means any changes to ODF `CustomResources` (CRs) will always reconcile back to default values. The other choices instead of `manage` are `init` and `ignore`. The setting of `init` for the service (i.e., cephBlockPools) will not reconcile back to default if changes are made to the ODF CR definition. The setting of `ignore` will not deploy the particular service.

oc create -f storagecluster.yaml
....

== Verifying the Installation

Deploy the Rook-Ceph toolbox pod.

[source,shell]
....
oc patch OCSInitialization ocsinit -n openshift-storage --type json --patch  '[{ "op": "replace", "path": "/spec/enableCephTools", "value": true }]'
....

Establish a remote shell to the toolbox pod.

[source,shell]
....
TOOLS_POD=$(oc get pods -n openshift-storage -l app=rook-ceph-tools -o name)
oc rsh -n openshift-storage $TOOLS_POD
....

Run `ceph status` and `ceph osd tree` to see that status of the Ceph
cluster.

[source,shell]
....
ceph status
....

[source,shell]
....
ceph osd tree
....

NOTE: Make sure to `exit` the toolbox pod.

=== Create test CephRBD PVC and CephFS PVC

[source]
....
cat <<EOF | oc apply -f -
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: rbd-pvc
spec:
  accessModes:
  - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 1Gi
  storageClassName: ocs-storagecluster-ceph-rbd
EOF
....

Validate new PVC is created.

[source,shell]
....
oc get pvc | grep rbd-pvc
....

[source]
....
cat <<EOF | oc apply -f -
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: cephfs-pvc
spec:
  accessModes:
  - ReadWriteMany
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 1Gi
  storageClassName: ocs-storagecluster-cephfs
EOF
....

Validate new PVC is created.

[source,shell]
....
oc get pvc | grep cephfs-pvc
....

== Upgrade from OCS 4.10 to ODF 4.11

ODF 4.11.0 is primarily for new customers or new clusters within existing customers.

Due to an upgrade issue in Red Hat Ceph Storage RGW, existing customers using
ODF 4.10 will be unable to upgrade to ODF 4.11 until a fix is provided in ODF
4.11.x, based on Red Hat Ceph Storage 5.3. More technical information on this
upgrade issue can be found https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_ceph_storage/5.2/html/release_notes/known-issues#known-issue_ceph-object-gateway[here]. Existing customers who need ODF 4.11 urgently and are not currently using ODF object storage, or are running ODF in the cloud, should contact Red Hat support for upgrade instructions. Customers who are new to ODF with the 4.11 release, or existing ODF 4.10 customers deploying ODF 4.11.0 onto new clusters, are unaffected by this upgrade problem.
