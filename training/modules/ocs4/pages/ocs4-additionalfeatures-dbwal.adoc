=== OSD BlueStore RocksDB metadata and WAL placement

With ODF 4.7 you can customized the deployment of your OSDs when it comes to what device to use
for what part of BlueStore. Let's consider a standard *StorageCluster* Custom Resource below:

[source,yaml]
----
---
apiVersion: ocs.openshift.io/v1
kind: StorageCluster
metadata:
  name: ocs-storagecluster
  namespace: openshift-storage
spec:
  manageNodes: false
  monDataDirHostPath: /var/lib/rook
  storageDeviceSets:
  - count: 1
    dataPVCTemplate:
      spec:
        accessModes:
        - ReadWriteOnce
        resources:
          requests:
            storage: {size}
        storageClassName: {storageclass}
        volumeMode: Block
    name: {deviceset-prefix}
    portable: false
    replica: 3
----

This will deploy a cluster in a very standard way where every piece of the OSD is collocated
on the PVC that will be provisioned using the storage class `\{storageclass\}`. The size of
the PersistentVolume that will be provisioned is specified as `\{size\}`.

==== RocksDB metadata placement

IMPORTANT: This feature is Development Preview.

You can now add the following section to your `storageDeviceSets` parameter to customize
the placement of RocksDB at deployment time.

[source,yaml]
----
    metadataPVCTemplate:
      spec:
        accessModes:
        - ReadWriteOnce
        resources:
          requests:
            storage: {size}
        storageClassName: {storageclass}
        volumeMode: Block
----

When added to your storage cluster the following will happen:

. Each OSD data will claim a PVC as `\{deviceset-prefix-x-data-y\}`
. Each OSD RockDB metadata will claim a PVC as `\{deviceset-prefix-x-metadata-y\}`

CAUTION: The deployment process will provision PVC and will not be able to partition
an existing device. Make sure to configure your RocksDB metadata partitions
before configuring LSO and before deploying your storage cluster.

==== RocksDB WAL placement

IMPORTANT: This feature is Development Preview.

You can now add the following section to your `storageDeviceSets` parameter to customize
the placement of the RocksDB Write Ahead Log (WAL) at deployment time.

[source,yaml]
----
    walPVCTemplate:
      spec:
        accessModes:
        - ReadWriteOnce
        resources:
          requests:
            storage: {size}
        storageClassName: {storageclass}
        volumeMode: Block
----

When added to your storage cluster the following will happen:

. Each OSD data will claim a PVC as `\{deviceset-prefix-x-data-y\}`
. Each OSD RockDB WAL will claim a PVC as `\{deviceset-prefix-x-wal-y\}`

NOTE: The WAL placement can be combined with the RocksDB metadata placement.

CAUTION: The deployment process will provision PVC and will not be able to partition
an existing device. Make sure to configure your RocksDB WAL partitions before configuringLSO
and before deploying your storage cluster.
