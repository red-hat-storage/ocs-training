## Adding Content

- Create a new branch in which you work. The branch name should include your name.
  * Including your name helps us in finding out if the branch can be recycled
- Only work inside of your branch
- *For Workloads* create a new folder in the scheme `ocs4<workload>` where workload should explain what your workload is about. Example: `ocs4metrics`
- Write your content in ASCIIdoc format - respect the ASCIIdoc styling information below

## ASCIIdoc styling

### Document header

It is best practice to copy this to the beginning of your workshop:

----
= YOUR TITLE
:toc: right
:toclevels: 2
:icons: font
:source-language: bash
:numbered:
// Activate experimental attribute for Keyboard Shortcut keys
:experimental:
----

This produces good defaults for your document.

### Executable commands

To make our lifes easier once we move over to Homeroom, please tag each executable command and follow this styling:

    [source,role="execute"]
    ----
    oc get replicaset -n openshift-monitoring
    ----
    .Example output:
    ----

### Do not require people to pull the repository

Expect people to not pull the ocs-training repository.

If you want to apply a specific file, use the raw link from within Github

image::imgs/Github-get-raw-link.png[]

[red]*Do NOT do this:*

Create kafka topic
```
oc apply -f 02-kafka-topic.yaml
```

[green]*Instead DO this:*

Create kafka topic
----
oc apply -f https://github.com/red-hat-storage/ocs-training/raw/master/ocs4kafka/02-kafka-topic.yaml
----

### Keyboard shortcuts

Keyboard shortcuts should leverage the built-in ASCIIdoc format

[red]*Do NOT do this:*

    press ``ctrl+c`` to cancel

[green]*Instead DO this:*

    press kbd:[Ctrl+C] to cancel


For this to work, you need to first activate the experimental features in your document by adding this to the top:

----
// Activate experimental attribute for Keyboard Shortcut keys
:experimental:
----

### Kubernetes objects should be printed in bold text

[red]*Do NOT do this:*

Once you finished these steps, you can see that we successfully mounted the rwx pvc inside of our toolbox pod, while it is also still mounted on the registry pods.

[green]*Instead DO this:*

Once you finished these steps, you can see that we successfully mounted the *RWX PVC* inside of our toolbox *Pod*, while it is also still mounted on the registry *Pods*.

### ASCIIdoc features and Github

Github unfortunately does not support many ASCIIdoc features. Until we are deploying inside of Homeroom, your lab needs to look decent inside of Github!

One of the features that Github lacks is `import:` to include another document inside of another document. It is up to you to verify that the ASCIIdoc you produce works on Github.
