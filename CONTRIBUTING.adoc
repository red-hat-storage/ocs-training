## Adding Content

- Create a new branch in which you work. The branch name should include your name.

- Only work inside of your branch
- Write your content in ASCIIdoc format - respect the ASCIIdoc styling information below

## Testing work locally

To test your work locally before we deploy it to master, you can execute this command in the root of your Git project:

[source]
----
# Podman
podman run -v $PWD:/antora:Z --rm -t antora/antora --cache-dir=./.cache/antora antora-playbook-local.yml
# Docker
docker run -v $PWD:/antora --rm -t antora/antora --cache-dir=./.cache/antora antora-playbook-local.yml
----

Afterwards you will find a new folder `build`. Point your browser to build/site/index.html in this git repository to preview your changes.


## ASCIIdoc styling

### Document header

It is best practice to copy this to the beginning of your workshop:

----
= YOUR TITLE
:icons: font
:source-language: bash
:numbered:
// Activate experimental attribute for Keyboard Shortcut keys
:experimental:
----

This produces good defaults for your document.

### Executable commands

To make our lifes easier once we move over to Homeroom, please tag each executable command and follow this styling:

    [source,role="execute"]
    ----
    oc get replicaset -n openshift-monitoring
    ----
    .Example output:
    ----
