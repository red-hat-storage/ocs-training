== Lab Overview

This hands-on workshop is for both system administrators and application developers interested in learning how to deploy and manage OpenShift Container Storage (OCS). In this lab you will be using OpenShift Container Platform (OCP) 4.x and the OCS operator to deploy Ceph and the Multi-Cloud-Gateway (MCG) as a persistent storage solution for OCP workloads.
This instruction was developed using the RHPDS `OpenShift 4.2 Workshop`. Instructions to `Order` this Workshop for Red Hat employees can be found at link:https://mojo.redhat.com/docs/DOC-1209703[OpenShift 4.2 Workshop]. If you are not a Red Hat employee you can deploy OpenShift 4 using this link link:http:try.openshift.com[OpenShift 4 Deployment] and then follow the instructions for AWS Installer-Provisioned Infrastructure (IPI).

NOTE: If deploying OpenShift 4 on VMware infrastructure or other User-Provisioned Infrastructure (UPI) skip the steps that include creating *machines* and *machinesets* given these resources are not currently available for UPI. To complete all of the instructions in this lab you will need to pre-provision six OCP worker nodes if OCP 4 is on UPI (i.e. not on AWS). To deploy OCS, OCP worker nodes need to have a minimum of 16 CPUs and 64 GB memory available.

=== In this lab you will learn how to

* Configure and deploy containerized Ceph and NooBaa
* Validate deployment of containerized Ceph and NooBaa
* Deploy the Rook toolbox to run Ceph and RADOS commands
* Creating a Read-Write-Once (RWO) PVC that is based on Ceph RBDs
* Creating a Read-Write-Many (RWX) PVC that is based on CephFS
* Use OCS for Prometheus and AlertManager storage
* Use the MCG to create a bucket and use in an application
* Add more storage to the Ceph cluster
* Use must-gather to collect support information

== Deploy your storage backend using the OCS operator

=== Scale OCP cluster and add 3 new nodes

In this section, you will first validate the OCP environment has 3 master and 3 worker nodes before increasing the cluster size by additional 3 worker nodes for OCS resources. The `NAME` of your OCP nodes will be different than shown below.

[source,role="execute"]
----
oc get nodes -l node-role.kubernetes.io/worker
----
.Example output:
[subs=attributes+]
----
NAME                                         STATUS   ROLES    AGE   VERSION
ip-10-0-138-9.{aws-region}.compute.internal     Ready    worker   77m   v1.14.6+9fb2d5cf9
ip-10-0-150-39.{aws-region}.compute.internal    Ready    worker   77m   v1.14.6+9fb2d5cf9
ip-10-0-170-49.{aws-region}.compute.internal    Ready    worker   77m   v1.14.6+9fb2d5cf9
----

Now you are going to add 3 more OCP compute nodes to cluster using *machinesets*.

[source,role="execute"]
----
oc get machinesets -n openshift-machine-api | grep -v infra
----

This will show you the existing *machinesets* used to create the 3 worker nodes in the cluster already. There is a *machineset* for each AWS AZ (us-east-1a, us-east-1b, us-east-1c). Your *machinesets* `NAME` will be different than below.

[subs=attributes+]
----
NAME                                       DESIRED   CURRENT   READY   AVAILABLE   AGE

cluster-ocs-0ec4-dgwqc-worker-{aws-region}b   1         1         1       1           86m
cluster-ocs-0ec4-dgwqc-worker-{aws-region}c   1         1         1       1           86m
----

WARNING: *Make sure you do the next step for finding and using your CLUSTERID*

[source,role="execute"]
----
CLUSTERID=$(oc get machineset -n openshift-machine-api -o jsonpath='{.items[0].metadata.labels.machine\.openshift\.io/cluster-api-cluster}')
echo $CLUSTERID
curl -s https://lfbf6bao0k.execute-api.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/machineset-lambda?clusterID=$CLUSTERID | oc apply -f -
----

Check that you have new *machines* created.

[source,role="execute"]
----
oc get machines -n openshift-machine-api | egrep 'NAME|workerocs'
----

They may be in `pending` for sometime so repeat command above until they are in a `running` STATE. The `NAME` of your machines will be different than shown below.

[subs=attributes+]
----
NAME                                                STATE     TYPE         REGION      ZONE         AGE
cluster-ocs-0ec4-dgwqc-workerocs-{aws-region}a-cqvwj   running   {instance-type}   {aws-region}   {aws-region}a   70s
cluster-ocs-0ec4-dgwqc-workerocs-{aws-region}b-g5p5v   running   {instance-type}   {aws-region}   {aws-region}b   70s
cluster-ocs-0ec4-dgwqc-workerocs-{aws-region}c-rx4v8   running   {instance-type}   {aws-region}   {aws-region}c   70s
----

You can see that the workerocs *machines* are using are also using the AWS EC2 instance type `{instance-type}`. The `{instance-type}` instance type follows our recommended instance sizing for OCS, 16 cpu and 64 GB mem.

Now you want to see if our new *machines* are added to the OCP cluster.

[source,role="execute"]
----
watch "oc get machinesets -n openshift-machine-api | egrep 'NAME|workerocs'"
----

This step could take more than 5 minutes. The result of this command needs to look like below before you proceed. All new workerocs *machinesets* should have an integer, in this case `1`, filled out for all rows and under columns `READY` and `AVAILABLE`. The `NAME` of your *machinesets* will be different than shown below.

[subs=attributes+]
----
NAME                                          DESIRED   CURRENT   READY   AVAILABLE   AGE
cluster-ocs-0ec4-dgwqc-workerocs-{aws-region}a   1         1         1       1           8m26s
cluster-ocs-0ec4-dgwqc-workerocs-{aws-region}b   1         1         1       1           8m26s
cluster-ocs-0ec4-dgwqc-workerocs-{aws-region}c   1         1         1       1           8m25s
----

You can exit by pressing kbd:[Ctrl+C]

Now check to see that you have 3 new OCP worker nodes. The `NAME` of your OCP nodes will be different than shown below.

[source,role="execute"]
----
oc get nodes -l node-role.kubernetes.io/worker
----
.Example output:

=== Installing the OCS operator

In this section you will be using three of the worker OCP 4 nodes to deploy OCS 4 using the OCS Operator in OperatorHub. The following will be installed:

- Groups and sources for the OCS operators
- An OCS subscription
- All OCS resources (Operators, Ceph pods, Noobaa pods, StorageClasses)

Start with creating the `openshift-storage` namespace.

[source,role="execute"]
----
oc create namespace openshift-storage
----

You must add the monitoring label to this namespace. This is required to get prometheus metrics and alerts for the OCP storage dashboards. To label the `openshift-storage` namespace use the following command:

[source,role="execute"]
----
oc label namespace openshift-storage "openshift.io/cluster-monitoring=true"
----

// NOTE: The below manifest file will not be needed when OCS 4 is released.

// To apply this manifest, execute the following:
// [source,role="execute"]
// ----
// ifdef::roadshow[]
// oc apply {{ HOME_PATH }}/support/ocslab_deploy-with-olm.yaml
// endif::[]
// ifdef::training[]
// oc apply -f http://bit.ly/ocs-olm-training
// endif::[]
// ----

Now switch over to your *Openshift Web Console*. You can get your URL by issuing command below to get the OCP 4 `console` route. Put this URL in a browser tab. You will use the same Admin username and password you used to login and use the `oc client` to login to the OCP 4 `console`.

[source,role="execute"]
----
oc get -n openshift-console route console
----

Once you are logged in, navigate to the *OperatorHub* menu.

.OCP OperatorHub
image::OCS-OCP-OperatorHub.png[OCP OperatorHub]

Now type `container storage` in the *Filter by _keyword..._* box.

.OCP OperatorHub filter on OpenShift Container Storage Operator
image::OCS-OCP-OperatorHub-Filter.png[OCP OperatorHub Filter]

Select `OpenShift Container Storage Operator` and then select *Install*.

.OCP OperatorHub Install OpenShift Container Storage
image::OCS-OCP-OperatorHub-Install.png[OCP OperatorHub Install]

On the next screen make sure the settings are as shown in this figure. Make sure to change to `A specific namespace on the cluster` and chose namespace `openshift-storage`. Click `Subscribe`.

.OCP Subscribe to OpenShift Container Storage
image::OCS-OCP-OperatorHub-Subscribe.png[OCP OperatorHub Subscribe]

Now you can go back to your terminal window to check the progress of the installation.

[source,role="execute"]
----
watch oc -n openshift-storage get csv
----
.Example output:
----
NAME                  DISPLAY                       VERSION   REPLACES   PHASE
ocs-operator.v4.2.0   OpenShift Container Storage   4.2.0                Succeeded
----

You can exit by pressing kbd:[Ctrl+C]

The resource `csv` is a shortened word for `clusterserviceversions.operators.coreos.com`.

.Please wait until the operator `PHASE` changes to `Succeeded`
CAUTION: This will mark that the installation of your operator was successful. Reaching this state can take several minutes.

You will now also see some new operator pods in the new `openshift-storage` namespace:

[source,role="execute"]
----
oc -n openshift-storage get pods
----
.Example output:
----
NAME                                 READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
noobaa-operator-6d59cd7855-lhwg8     1/1     Running   0          79s
ocs-operator-dc48d685-8qtqn          1/1     Running   0          79s
rook-ceph-operator-d857c476f-4npzl   1/1     Running   0          79s
----

Now switch back to your *Openshift Web Console* for the remainder of the installation for OCS 4.

Navigate to the `Operators` menu on the left and select `Installed Operators`. Make sure the selected project is set to `openshift-storage`.
What you see, should be similar to the following example picture:

.Installed operators:  1) Make sure you are in the right project; 2) Check Operator status; 3) Click on Openshift Container Storage Operator
image::OCP-installed-operators.png[Openshift showing the installed operators in namespace openshift-storage]

Click on `Openshift Container Storage Operator` to get to the OCS configuration screen.

.OCS configuration screen
image::OCS-config-screen-all.png[OCS configuration screen]

On the top of the OCS configuration screen, scroll over to the right and click on `Storage cluster` and then click on `Create OCS Cluster Service`. If you do not see `Create OCS Cluster Service` refresh your browser window.

.OCS Create Storage Cluster
image::OCS-config-screen-storage-cluster.png[OCS Create Storage Cluster]

A dialog box will come up next.

.OCS create a new storage cluster
image::OCS-config-screen-new.png[OCS create a new storage cluster]

CAUTION: *Make sure to select three workers in different availability zones using instructions below*

To select the appropriate worker nodes of your OCP 4 cluster you can find them by searching for the node label `role=storage-node`.

[source,role="execute"]
----
oc get nodes --show-labels | grep storage-node |cut -d' ' -f1
----

Select the three nodes that resulted from the command above. Then click on the button `Create` below the dialog box where you selected the 3 workers with a `checkmark`.

In the background this will start initiating a lot of new pods in the `openshift-storage` namespace, as can be seen on the CLI:

[source,role="execute"]
----
oc -n openshift-storage get pods
----

### Getting to know the Storage Dashboards

You can now also check the status of your storage cluster with the OCS specific *Dashboards* that are included in your *Openshift Web Console*. You can reach this by clicking on `Home` on your left navigation bar, then selecting `Dashboards` and finally clicking on `Persistent Storage` on the top navigation bar of the content page.

NOTE: If you just finished your OCS 4 deployment it could take 5-10 minutes for your *Dashboards* to fully populate.

.OCS Dashboard after successful backing storage installation

|<4> | Events | Live overview of all the changes that are being done affecting the storage cluster
|<5> | Utilization | Overview of the storage cluster usage and performance
|===

OCS ships with a *Dashboard* for the Object Store service as well. From within the *Dashboard* menu click on the `Object Service` on the top navigation bar of the content page.

.OCS Multi-Cloud-Gateway Dashboard after successful installation
image::OCS-noobaa-dashboard-healthy.png[OCS Multi-Cloud-Gateway Dashboard after successful installation]

[cols="0,1,10a"]

|<3> | Buckets | List of all the ObjectBucket with are offered and ObjectBucketClaims which are connected to them
|<4> | Resource Providers | Shows the list of configured Resource Providers that are available as backing storage in the MCG
|===

// On the left side of this *Dashboard* you see a blue link labelled `noobaa`, which will get you to the NooBaa Management Console. We will discuss this Management Console later in more detail.

Once this is all healthy, you will be able to use the three new *StorageClasses* created during the OCS 4 Install:

- ocs-storagecluster-ceph-rbd
- ocs-storagecluster-cephfs
- openshift-storage.noobaa.io

You can see these three *StorageClasses* from the Openshift Web Console by expanding the `Storage` menu in the left navigation bar and selecting `Storage Classes`. You can also run the command below:

[source,role="execute"]
----
oc -n openshift-storage get sc
----

Please make sure the three storage classes are available in your cluster before proceeding.

NOTE: The NooBaa pod used the `ocs-storagecluster-ceph-rbd` storage class for creating a PVC for mounting to it's `db` container.

=== Using the Rook-Ceph toolbox to check on the Ceph backing storage

Since the Rook-Ceph *toolbox* is not shipped with OCS, we need to deploy it manually. For this, we can leverage the upstream `toolbox.yaml` file, but we need to modify the namespace as shown below.

[source,role="execute"]
----
ifdef::roadshow[]
oc apply {{ HOME_PATH }}/support/ocslab_toolbox.yaml
endif::[]
ifdef::training[]
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rook/rook/release-1.1/cluster/examples/kubernetes/ceph/toolbox.yaml | sed 's/namespace: rook-ceph/namespace: openshift-storage/g'| oc apply -f -
endif::[]
----

After the `rook-ceph-tools` *Pod* is `Running` you can access the toolbox like this:

[source,role="execute"]
----
TOOLS_POD=$(oc get pods -n openshift-storage -l app=rook-ceph-tools -o name)
oc rsh -n openshift-storage $TOOLS_POD
----

Once inside the toolbox, try out the following Ceph commands:

[source,role="execute"]
----
ceph status
----

[source,role="execute"]
----
ceph osd status
----

[source,role="execute"]
----
ceph osd tree
----

[source,role="execute"]
----
ceph df
----

[source,role="execute"]
----
rados df
----

[source,role="execute"]
----
ceph versions
----

.Example output:
[source]
----
sh-4.2# ceph status

  io:
    client:   1.2 KiB/s rd, 39 KiB/s wr, 2 op/s rd, 3 op/s wr
----

You can exit the toolbox by either pressing kbd:[Ctrl+D] or by executing

[source,role="execute"]
----
exit
----

== Create a new OCP application deployment using Ceph RBD volume

In this section the `ocs-storagecluster-ceph-rbd` *storage class* will be used by an OCP application + database *deployment* to create RWO (ReadWriteOnce) persistent storage. The persistent storage will be a Ceph RBD (RADOS Block Device) volume (object) in the Ceph pool `ocs-storagecluster-cephblockpool`.

To do so we have created a template file, based on the OpenShift rails-pgsql-persistent template, that includes an extra parameter STORAGE_CLASS that enables the end user to specify the storage class the PVC should use.
Feel free to download `{github-raw-url}/ocp4ocs4/configurable-rails-app.yaml` to check on the format of this template. Search for `STORAGE_CLASS` in the downloaded content.

Make sure that you completed all previous sections so that you are ready to start the Rails + PostgreSQL deployment.

[source,role="execute",subs=attributes+]
----
oc new-project my-database-app
ifdef::roadshow[]
oc new-app {{ HOME_PATH }}/support/ocslab_rails-app.yaml -p STORAGE_CLASS=ocs-storagecluster-ceph-rbd -p VOLUME_CAPACITY=5Gi
endif::[]
ifdef::training[]
curl {github-raw-url}/ocp4ocs4/configurable-rails-app.yaml | oc new-app -p STORAGE_CLASS=ocs-storagecluster-ceph-rbd -p VOLUME_CAPACITY=5Gi -f -
endif::[]
----

After the deployment is started you can monitor with these commands.

[source,role="execute"]
----
oc status
----

Check the PVC that were created.

[source,role="execute"]
----
oc get pvc -n my-database-app
----

This step could take 5 or more minutes. Wait until there are 2 *Pods* in `Running` STATUS and 4 *Pods* in `Completed` STATUS as shown below.

[source,role="execute"]
----
watch oc get pods -n my-database-app
----
.Example output:
----
NAME                                READY   STATUS      RESTARTS   AGE
postgresql-1-deploy                 0/1     Completed   0          5m48s
postgresql-1-lf7qt                  1/1     Running     0          5m40s
rails-pgsql-persistent-1-build      0/1     Completed   0          5m49s
rails-pgsql-persistent-1-deploy     0/1     Completed   0          3m36s
rails-pgsql-persistent-1-hook-pre   0/1     Completed   0          3m28s
rails-pgsql-persistent-1-pjh6q      1/1     Running     0          3m14s
----

You can exit by pressing kbd:[Ctrl+C]

Once the deployment is complete you can now test the application and the persistent storage on Ceph. Your `HOST/PORT` will be different.

[source,role="execute"]
----
oc get route -n my-database-app
----
.Example output:
----
NAME                     HOST/PORT                                                                         PATH   SERVICES                 PORT    TERMINATION   WILDCARD
rails-pgsql-persistent   rails-pgsql-persistent-my-database-app.apps.cluster-a26e.sandbox449.opentlc.com          rails-pgsql-persistent
----

Copy your `rails-pgsql-persistent` route (different than above) to a browser window to create articles. You will need to append `/articles` to the end.

*Example*  http://<your_route>/articles

Enter the `username` and `password` below to create articles and comments. The articles and comments are saved in a PostgreSQL database which stores its table spaces on the Ceph RBD volume provisioned using the `ocs-storagecluster-ceph-rbd` *storageclass* during the application deployment.

[source,ini]
----
username: openshift
password: secret
----

Lets now take another look at the Ceph `ocs-storagecluster-cephblockpool` created by the `ocs-storagecluster-ceph-rbd` *Storage Class*. Log into the *toolbox* pod again.

[source,role="execute"]
----
TOOLS_POD=$(oc get pods -n openshift-storage -l app=rook-ceph-tools -o name)
oc rsh -n openshift-storage $TOOLS_POD
----

Run the same Ceph commands as before the application deployment and compare to results in prior section. Notice the number of objects in `ocs-storagecluster-cephblockpool` has increased. The third command lists RBDs and we should now have two RBDs.

[source,role="execute"]
----
ceph df
rados df
rbd -p ocs-storagecluster-cephblockpool ls | grep vol
----

You can exit the toolbox by either pressing kbd:[Ctrl+D] or by executing `exit`.

=== Matching PVs to RBDs

A handy way to match persistent volumes to Ceph RBDs is to execute:

[source,role="execute"]
----
oc get pv -o 'custom-columns=NAME:.spec.claimRef.name,PVNAME:.metadata.name,STORAGECLASS:.spec.storageClassName,VOLUMEHANDLE:.spec.csi.volumeHandle'
----
.Example output:
----
NAME                      PVNAME                                     STORAGECLASS                  VOLUMEHANDLE

----

The second half of the `VOLUMEHANDLE` column mostly matches what your RBD is named inside of Ceph. All you have to do is append `csi-vol-` to the front like this:

.Get the full RBD name of our postgreSQL PV in one command
[source,role="execute"]
----
oc get pv pvc-4ca89d3d-2060-11ea-9a42-02dfa51cba90 -o jsonpath='{.spec.csi.volumeHandle}' | cut -d '-' -f 6- | awk '{print "csi-vol-"$1}'
----

[NOTE]
====
You will need to adjust the above command to use your `PVNAME` name
====

.Example output:
----
csi-vol-4cbba393-2060-11ea-9396-0a580a800406
----

Now we can check on the details of our RBD from inside of the tools pod:

[source,role="execute"]
----
TOOLS_POD=$(oc get pods -n openshift-storage -l app=rook-ceph-tools -o name)
oc rsh -n openshift-storage $TOOLS_POD rbd -p ocs-storagecluster-cephblockpool info csi-vol-4cbba393-2060-11ea-9396-0a580a800406
----
.Example output:
----

----

[NOTE]
====
You will need to adjust the above command to use your `RBD` name
====

== Create a new OCP application deployment using CephFS volume

In this section the `ocs-storagecluster-cephfs` *Storage Class* will be used to create a RWX (ReadWriteMany) PVC that can be used by multiple pods at the same time. The application we will use is called `File Uploader`.

Create a new project:

[source,role="execute"]
----
oc new-project my-shared-storage
----

Next deploy the example PHP application called `file-uploader`:

[source,role="execute"]
----
oc new-app openshift/php:7.1~https://github.com/christianh814/openshift-php-upload-demo --name=file-uploader
----

.Sample Output:
----

    Apache 2.4 with PHP 7.1
    -----------------------
    PHP 7.1 available as container is a base platform for building and running various PHP 7.1 applications and frameworks. PHP is an HTML-embedded scripting language. PHP attempts to make it easy for developers to write dynamically generated web pages. PHP also offers built-in database integration for several commercial and non-commercial database management systems, so writing a database-enabled webpage with PHP is fairly simple. The most common use of PHP coding is probably as a replacement for CGI scripts.

    Tags: builder, php, php71, rh-php71

Push successful
----

The command prompt returns out of the tail mode once you see _Push successful_.

[NOTE]
====
This use of the `new-app` command directly asked for application code to be
built and did not involve a template. That's why it only created a *single
Pod* deployment with a *Service* and no *Route*.
====

Let's make our application production ready by exposing it via a `Route` and scale to 3 instances for high availability:

[source,role="execute"]
----
oc expose svc/file-uploader -n my-shared-storage
----
[source,role="execute"]
----
oc scale --replicas=3 dc/file-uploader -n my-shared-storage
----
[source,role="execute"]
----
oc get pods -n my-shared-storage
----

You should have 3 `file-uploader` *Pods* in a few minutes.

[CAUTION]
====
Never attempt to store persistent data in a *Pod* that has no persistent
volume associated with it. *Pods* and their containers are ephemeral by
definition, and any stored data will be lost as soon as the *Pod* terminates
for whatever reason.
====

The app is of course not useful like this. We can fix this by providing shared
storage to this app.

You can create a *PersistentVolumeClaim* and attach it into an application with
the `oc set volume` command. Execute the following

[source,role="execute"]
----
oc set volume dc/file-uploader --add --name=my-shared-storage \
-t pvc --claim-mode=ReadWriteMany --claim-size=1Gi \
--claim-name=my-shared-storage --claim-class=ocs-storagecluster-cephfs \
--mount-path=/opt/app-root/src/uploaded \
-n my-shared-storage
----

This command will:

* create a *PersistentVolumeClaim*
* update the *DeploymentConfig* to include a `volume` definition
* update the *DeploymentConfig* to attach a `volumemount` into the specified
  `mount-path`
* cause a new deployment of the 3 application *Pods*

For more information on what `oc set volume` is capable of, look at its help output
with `oc set volume -h`. Now, let's look at the result of adding the volume:

[source,role="execute"]
----
oc get pvc -n my-shared-storage
----

.Sample Output:
----
NAME                STATUS   VOLUME                                     CAPACITY   ACCESS MODES   STORAGECLASS                AGE
my-shared-storage   Bound    pvc-371c2184-fb73-11e9-b901-0aad1a53052d   1Gi        RWX            ocs-storagecluster-cephfs   47s
----

Notice the `ACCESSMODE` being set to *RWX* (short for `ReadWriteMany`).

All 3 `file-uploader`*Pods* are using the same *RWX* volume. Without this `ACCESSMODE`, OpenShift will not attempt to attach multiple *Pods* to the same *PersistentVolume*
reliably. If you attempt to scale up deployments that are using *RWO* or `ReadWriteOnce` storage, the *Pods* will actually all become co-located on the same
node.

Try it out in your file uploader web application using your browser. Upload
new files.

Now, check the *Route* that has been created:

[source,role="execute"]
----
oc get route file-uploader -n my-shared-storage -o jsonpath --template="{.spec.host}"
----

This will return a route similar to this one (careful: there is no line break at the end so your shell prompt appears right after the output).

.Sample Output:
----
file-uploader-my-shared-storage.apps.cluster-ocs-9b06.ocs-9b06.example.opentlc.com
----

Point your browser to the web application using the URL advertised by your route. *Your `route` will be different*

The web app simply lists all uploaded files and offers the ability to upload new ones as well as download the existing data. Right now there is
nothing.

Select an arbitrary file from your local machine and upload it to the app.

== Using OCS for Prometheus Metrics

OpenShift ships with a pre-configured and self-updating monitoring stack that is based on the Prometheus open source project and its wider eco-system. It provides monitoring of cluster components and ships with a set of alerts to immediately notify the cluster administrator about any occurring problems.

For production environments, it is highly recommended to configure persistent storage using block storage technology. OCS 4 provide block storage using Ceph RBD volumes. Running cluster monitoring with persistent storage means that your metrics are stored to a persistent volume and can survive a pod being restarted or recreated. This is ideal if you require your metrics or alerting data to be guarded from data loss. For production environments, it is highly recommended to configure persistent storage using block storage technology. OCS 4 provide block storage using Ceph RBD volumes. The following instructions will detail how to migrate Prometheus and Alertmanager storage to Ceph RBD volumes for persistence.

First, let's discover what *Pods* and *PVCs* are installed in the `openshift-monitoring` namespace.

ifdef::roadshow[]
In the prior module, OpenShift Infrastructure Nodes, the Prometheus and AlertManager resources were moved to the OCP infra nodes.

----

At this point there are no *PVC* resources because Prometheus and AlertManager are both using ephemeral (EmptyDir) storage. This is the way OpenShift is initially installed. The Prometheus stack consists of the Prometheus database and the alertmanager data. Persisting both is best-practice since data loss on either of these will cause you to lose your collected metrics and alerting data.

### Modifying your Prometheus environment

For Prometheus every supported configuration change is controlled through a central *ConfigMap*, which needs to exist before we can make changes. When you start off with a clean installation of Openshift, the ConfigMap to configure the Prometheus environment may not be present. To check if your ConfigMap is present, execute this:

[source,role="execute"]
----
oc -n openshift-monitoring get configmap cluster-monitoring-config
----
.Output if the ConfigMap is not yet created:
----
Error from server (NotFound): configmaps "cluster-monitoring-config" not found
----

.Output if the ConfigMap is created:
----
NAME                        DATA   AGE
cluster-monitoring-config   1      116m
----

If you are missing the *ConfigMap*, create it using this command:

[source,role="execute",subs=attributes+]
----
ifdef::roadshow[]
oc apply {{ HOME_PATH }}/support/ocslab_cluster-monitoring-noinfra.yaml
endif::[]
ifdef::training[]
oc apply -f {github-raw-url}/ocp4ocs4/cluster-monitoring-config.yaml
endif::[]
----
.Sample output:
----
configmap/cluster-monitoring-config created
----

ifdef::roadshow[]
[NOTE]
====
If the *ConfigMap* already exists because of completing prior module `OpenShift Infrastructure Nodes`, you will apply changes to the existing *ConfigMap*.
[source,role="execute"]
----
oc apply {{ HOME_PATH }}/support/ocslab_cluster-monitoring-withinfra.yaml
----
.Sample output:
----
configmap/cluster-monitoring-config updated
----
====
endif::[]

You can view the *ConfigMap* with the following command:

NOTE: The size of the Ceph RBD volumes, `40Gi`, can be modified to be larger or smaller depending on requirements.

[source,role="execute"]
----
oc -n openshift-monitoring get configmap cluster-monitoring-config -o yaml
----

.ConfigMap sample output:
[source,yaml]
----
...
      volumeClaimTemplate:
        metadata:
          name: prometheusdb
        spec:
          storageClassName: ocs-storagecluster-ceph-rbd
          resources:
            requests:
              storage: 40Gi
...
      volumeClaimTemplate:
        metadata:
          name: alertmanager
        spec:
          storageClassName: ocs-storagecluster-ceph-rbd
          resources:
            requests:
              storage: 40Gi
...
----

Once you create this new *ConfigMap* `cluster-monitoring-config`, the affected *Pods* will automatically be restarted and the new storage will be mounted in the Pods.

[NOTE]
====
It is not possible to retain data that was written on the default EmptyDir-based or ephemeral installation. Thus you will start with an empty DB after changing the backend storage thereby starting over with metric collection and reporting.
====

After a couple of minutes, the AlertManager and Prometheus *Pods* will have restarted and you will see new *PVCs* in the `openshift-monitoring` namespace that they are now providing persistent storage.

[source,role="execute"]
----
oc get pods,pvc -n openshift-monitoring

.Example output:
[source,yaml]

You can validate that Prometheus and AlertManager are working correctly after moving to persistent storage <<Monitoring the OCS environment,in a later section>> of this lab guide.

== Using the Multi-Cloud-Gateway

This section discusses the usage of the Multi-Cloud-Gateway (MCG). Currently the best way to configure the MCG is to use the CLI.

ifdef::training[]
To install the CLI follow the <<Install the NooBaa CLI client>> section.
endif::[]

NOTE: While the NooBaa Web Management Console is accessible, it should not be used to create any resources, since they are currently not synchronized back to the Openshift cluster.

=== Checking on the MCG status

The MCG status can be checked with the NooBaa CLI. Make sure you are in the `openshift-storage` project when you execute this command.

----

As you can see - the NooBaa CLI will first check on the environment and will then print all the information about the environment.
Besides the status of the MCG, the second most intersting information for us are the available S3 addresses that we can use to connect to our MCG buckets. We can chose between using the external DNS which incurs DNS traffic cost, or route internally inside of our Openshift cluster.

You can get a more basic overview of the MCG status using the Object Storage *Dashboard*. To reach this, log into the *Openshift Web Console*, click on `Home` and select the `Dashboards` item. In the main view, select `Object Service` in the top navigation bar.
This dashboard does not give you connection information for your S3 endpoint, but offers Graphs and runtime information about the usage of your S3 backend.

=== Creating an Object Bucket Claim

An Object Bucket Claim (OBC) can be used to request a S3 compatible bucket backend for your workloads. When creating an OBC you get a ConfigMap (CM) and a Secret that together contain all the information your application needs to use the object storage service.

Creating an OBC is as simple as using the NooBaa CLI:

[source,role="execute"]
----
noobaa obc create test21obc -n openshift-storage
----
.Example output:
----
INFO[0001] ✅ Created: ObjectBucketClaim "test21obc"
----

The NooBaa CLI has created the necessary configuration inside of NooBaa and has informed Openshift about the new OBC:

[source,role="execute"]
----
oc get obc -n openshift-storage
----
.Example output:
----

As you can see, the secret gives us the S3 access credentials, while the CM contains the S3 endpoint information for our application.

=== Using an OBC inside a container

In this section we will see how one can create an OBC using a YAML file and use the provided S3 configuration in an example application.

To deploy the OBC and the example application we apply this YAML file:

----

The first part creates an OBC that will create a ConfigMap and a secret that have the same name as the OBC (`obc-test`). The second part of the file (after the `---`), creates a Job that deploys a container with the s3cmd pre-installed. It will execute s3cmd with the appropriate command line arguments and exit. S3cmd will in this case report the current disk usage of our S3 endpoint and exit, which will mark our *Pod* as `Completed`.

Let's try this out:

.Deploy the Manifest:
[source,role="execute",subs=attributes+]
----
ifdef::roadshow[]
oc apply {{ HOME_PATH }}/support/ocslab_obc-app-example.yaml
endif::[]
ifdef::training[]
curl -s {github-raw-url}/ocp4ocs4/obc_app_example.yaml | oc apply -f -
endif::[]
----
.Example output:
----
namespace/obc-test created
objectbucketclaim.objectbucket.io/obc-test created
job.batch/obc-test created
----

Afterwards watch the *Pod* be Created, Run and finally be marked `Completed` like below - be aware that your Pod name will differ:

[source,role="execute"]
----
oc get pods -n obc-test -l app=obc-test
----
.Example output:
----
NAME             READY   STATUS      RESTARTS   AGE
obc-test-bvg8h   0/1     Completed   0          22s
----

Then you can check the `obc-test` *Pod* logs for the contents of the S3 bucket using the command below (in this case there are zero objects in the bucket).

NOTE: Fetching the obc-test log via the `oc` command does not work correctly. It does work using the `kubectl` command.

[source,role="execute"]
----
kubectl logs -n obc-test -l app=obc-test
----
.Example output:
----
+ s3cmd --no-check-certificate --host 10.0.140.19:30052 --host-bucket 10.0.140.19:30052 du
0        0 objects s3://obc-test-noobaa-784461cb-1e77-4ccf-b62d-007a6ae3ef15/
--------
0        Total
----

As we can see above, we can access one bucket, which is currently empty. This proves that the access credentials from the OBC work and are set up correctly inside of the container. +
Most applications support reading out the `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` environment variables natively, but you will have to figure out how to set the host and bucket name for each application. In our example we used CLI flags of s3cmd for this.

== Adding storage to the Ceph Cluster

Adding storage to OCS adds capacity and performance to your already present cluster.

[NOTE]
====
The reason for adding more OCP worker nodes for storage is because the existing nodes do not have adequate CPU and/or Memory available.
====

=== Add storage worker nodes

This section will explain how one can add more worker nodes to the present storage cluster. Afterwards follow the next sub-section on how to extend the OCS cluster to provision storage on these new nodes.

To add more nodes, we could either add more machinesets like we did before, or scale the already present OCS machinesets. For this training, we will spawn more workers by scaling the already present OCS worker instances up:

.Check on our present machinesets:
[source,role="execute"]
----
oc get machinesets -n openshift-machine-api | egrep 'NAME|workerocs'
----
Example output:
[subs=attributes+]
----
NAME                                          DESIRED   CURRENT   READY   AVAILABLE   AGE
cluster-ocs-0ec4-dgwqc-workerocs-{aws-region}a   1         1         1       1           3h50m
cluster-ocs-0ec4-dgwqc-workerocs-{aws-region}b   1         1         1       1           3h50m
cluster-ocs-0ec4-dgwqc-workerocs-{aws-region}c   1         1         1       1           3h50m
----

Let's scale the workerocs machinesets up with this command:

[source,role="execute"]
----
oc get machinesets -n openshift-machine-api -o name | grep workerocs | xargs -n1 -t oc scale -n openshift-machine-api --replicas=2
----
.Example output:
[subs=attributes+]
----
oc scale -n openshift-machine-api --replicas=2 machineset.machine.openshift.io/cluster-ocs-0ec4-dgwqc-workerocs-{aws-region}a
machineset.machine.openshift.io/cluster-ocs-0ec4-dgwqc-workerocs-{aws-region}a scaled
oc scale -n openshift-machine-api --replicas=2 machineset.machine.openshift.io/cluster-ocs-0ec4-dgwqc-workerocs-{aws-region}b
machineset.machine.openshift.io/cluster-ocs-0ec4-dgwqc-workerocs-{aws-region}b scaled
oc scale -n openshift-machine-api --replicas=2 machineset.machine.openshift.io/cluster-ocs-0ec4-dgwqc-workerocs-{aws-region}c
machineset.machine.openshift.io/cluster-ocs-0ec4-dgwqc-workerocs-{aws-region}c scaled
----

Wait until the new workers are available. This could take 5 minutes or more so be patient.
[source,role="execute"]
----
watch "oc get machinesets -n openshift-machine-api | egrep 'NAME|workerocs'"
----

You can exit by pressing kbd:[Ctrl+C].

Once they are available, we can check on which worker nodes do not have OCS label applied yet, these are the new workers just created.

[source,role="execute"]
----
oc get node --show-labels | grep storage-node | grep -v openshift-storage | cut -d' ' -f1
----
.Example output:
[subs=attributes+]
----
ip-10-0-133-99.{aws-region}.compute.internal
ip-10-0-158-153.{aws-region}.compute.internal
ip-10-0-160-200.{aws-region}.compute.internal
----

We can see that there are three new nodes, which do not yet have the `cluster.ocs.openshift.io/openshift-storage` label applied yet. We will apply this now:

[source,role="execute"]
----
oc get nodes -o json | jq '.items[] | select(.metadata.labels.role == "storage-node") | .metadata.name' | xargs -n1 -t -I {} oc label nodes {} cluster.ocs.openshift.io/openshift-storage=""
----
.Example output:
[subs=attributes+]
----
oc label nodes ip-10-0-131-209.{aws-region}.compute.internal cluster.ocs.openshift.io/openshift-storage=
error: 'cluster.ocs.openshift.io/openshift-storage' already has a value (), and --overwrite is false
oc label nodes ip-10-0-133-99.{aws-region}.compute.internal cluster.ocs.openshift.io/openshift-storage=
node/ip-10-0-133-99.{aws-region}.compute.internal labeled
oc label nodes ip-10-0-155-12.{aws-region}.compute.internal cluster.ocs.openshift.io/openshift-storage=
error: 'cluster.ocs.openshift.io/openshift-storage' already has a value (), and --overwrite is false
oc label nodes ip-10-0-158-153.{aws-region}.compute.internal cluster.ocs.openshift.io/openshift-storage=
node/ip-10-0-158-153.{aws-region}.compute.internal labeled
oc label nodes ip-10-0-160-200.{aws-region}.compute.internal cluster.ocs.openshift.io/openshift-storage=
node/ip-10-0-160-200.{aws-region}.compute.internal labeled
oc label nodes ip-10-0-162-215.{aws-region}.compute.internal cluster.ocs.openshift.io/openshift-storage=
error: 'cluster.ocs.openshift.io/openshift-storage' already has a value (), and --overwrite is false
----

You will see errors for the nodes which already had the OCS label applied, which is fine. +
Now that you have the new instances prepared for extending the cluster by adding the OCS label, the next step is to add more storage to the Ceph cluster. The OCS operator will prefer the new OCP nodes because they have no OCS resources scheduled yet.

=== Add storage capacity

In this section we will add storage capacity and performance to the configured OCS worker nodes and the Ceph cluster. If you have followed the previous section you should now have 6 OCS nodes.

To add storage, go to the *Openshift Web Console* and follow these steps to reach the OCS storage cluster overview:

 - Click on `Operators` on the left navigation bar
 - Select `Installed Operators` and select `openshift-storage` project
 - Click on `Openshift Container Storage Operator`
 - In the top navigation bar, scroll right to find the item `Storage Cluster` and click on it

image::OCS-Storage-Cluster-overview-reachit.png[]

 - The visible list should list only one item - click on the three dots on the far right to extend the options menu
 - Select `Add Capacity` from the options menu

.Add capacity dialog
image::OCS-add-capacity.png[]

In the new dialog you can set the requested additional (usable) capacity and the storage class. On AWS, the storage class should be set to `gp2`.

NOTE: The effectively provisioned capacity will be three times as much as you put into the `Requested Capacity` field, because OCS uses a replica count of 3.

Once you are done with your setting, proceed by clicking on `Add`. You will see the Status of the Storage Cluster change until it reaches `Ready` again.

You can now see that there are new OSD pods:

[source,role="execute"]
----
oc get pod -o=custom-columns=NAME:.metadata.name,STATUS:.status.phase,NODE:.spec.nodeName -n openshift-storage | grep osd
----
.Example output:
[subs=attributes+]
----

----

This is everything that you need to do to extend the OCS storage.

=== Verify new storage

Once you added the capacity and made sure that the OSD pods are present, you can also optionally check the additional storage capacity using the Ceph tools. To do this, follow these steps:

.Enter the tools pod that you created in <<Using the Rook-Ceph toolbox to check on the Ceph backing storage,the previous section>>:
[source,role="execute"]
----
TOOLS_POD=$(oc get pods -n openshift-storage -l app=rook-ceph-tools -o name)
oc rsh -n openshift-storage $TOOLS_POD
----

.Check the status of the Ceph cluster:
[source,role="execute"]
----
ceph status
----
.Example output:
----
sh-4.2# ceph status
  cluster:
    id:     786dbab2-ae4f-4352-8d83-5e27c6a4f341
    health: HEALTH_OK

  services:
    mon: 3 daemons, quorum a,b,c (age 6h)
    mgr: a(active, since 6h)
    mds: ocs-storagecluster-cephfilesystem:1 {0=ocs-storagecluster-cephfilesystem-a=up:active} 1 up:standby-replay
    osd: 6 osds: 6 up (since 6m), 6 in (since 6m) <1>

  data:
    pools:   3 pools, 24 pgs
    objects: 182 objects, 311 MiB
    usage:   6.7 GiB used, 6.0 TiB / 6.0 TiB avail <2>
    pgs:     24 active+clean

  io:
    client:   853 B/s rd, 43 KiB/s wr, 1 op/s rd, 3 op/s wr
----

In the Ceph status output, we can already see that:

<1> We now use 6 osds in total and they are `up` and `in` (meaning the daemons are running and being used to store data)
<2> The available raw capacity has increased from 3 TiB to 6 TiB

Besides that, nothing has changed in the output.

.Check the topology of your cluster:
[source,role="execute"]
----
ceph osd crush tree
----
.Example output:
----

 -1       5.99396 root default

  3   ssd 0.99899                 osd.3
----

<1> We now have additional hosts, which are extending the hosts in the respective zone

Since our Ceph cluster's CRUSH rules are set up to replicate data between the zones, this is an effective way to relax the load on the previous nodes.

Existing data on the original OSDs will be balanced out automatically, so that the old and the new OSDs share the load.

Disconnect from the Ceph toolbox pod.

== Monitoring the OCS environment

This section covers the different tools available with OCS 4.2 when it comes to monitoring the environment. This section relies on the existing UI.

Individuals already familiar with OCP will feel comfortable with this section but for those who are not, it will be a good bootstrap.

The tools are accessible through the main UI window left pane. Click the *Monitoring* menu item to expand and have access to the following 3 choices:

* Alerting
* Metrics
* Dashboards

=== Alerting

Click on the *Alerting* item to open the Alert window as illustrated in the screen capture below.

.OCP Monitoring Menu
image::metrics-alertingleftpanemenu.png[OCP Monitoring Menu]

This will take you to the *Alerting* homepage as illustrated below.

.OCP Alerting Homepage
image::metrics-alertinghomepage.png[OCP Alerting Homepage]

You can display the alerts in the main window by state. To do so you must highlight the states you want to display. The states are:

* `Firing` - Alert has been confirmed
* `Silenced` - Alerts that have been silenced while they were in `Pending` or `Firing` state
* `Pending` - Alerts that have been triggered but not confirmed
* `Not Firing` - Alerts that have not been triggered

NOTE: An alert transitions from `Pending` to `Firing` state if it persists for more than the amount of time configured in the alert definition (e.g. 10 minutes for the `CephClusterWarningState` alert).

As illustrated below, you can filter the alerts being displayed based on their state. Just click on the states to display to toggle the filter. The states highlighted in blue will be displayed.

NOTE: You need at least one state highlighted.

.OCP Alerting Status Filtering
image::metrics-alertingstatusfilter.png[OCP Alert Status Filtering]

As illustrated below, you can also filter alerts by name using the *Filter* area on the top right of the window to search for a particular alert or set of alerts.

.OCP Alerting Name Filtering
image::metrics-alertingnamefilter.png[OCP Alert Name Filtering]

Through the 3 dot icon on the right hand side of each alert line you have access to a contextual menu to either view the alert definition or to silence the alert.

.OCP Alert Contextual Menu
image::metrics-alertingcontextualmenu.png[OCP Alert Contextual Menu]

If you select `View Alerting Rule` you will get access to the details of the rule that triggered the alert. The details include the Prometheus query used by the alert to perform the detection of the condition.

.OCP Alert Detail Display
image::metrics-alertingviewrule.png[OCP Alert Detailed Display]

NOTE: If desired, you can click the Prometheus query embedded in the alert. Doing so will take you to the *Metrics* page where you will be able to execute the alert and to test updates to the alert.

=== Metrics

Click on the *Metrics* item as illustrated below.

.OCP Metrics Menu
image::metrics-metricsleftpanemenu.png[OCP Metrics Menu]

This will take you to the *Metrics* homepage as illustrated below.

.OCP UI Metrics Homepage
image::metrics-queryfield.png[OCP Monitoring Metrics Homepage]

Use the query field to either enter the formula of your choice or to search for metrics by name. The metrics available will let you query both OCP related information or OCS related information. The queries can be simple or complex using the Prometheus query syntax and all its available functions.

Let's start testing a simple query example and enter the following text `ceph_osd_op` in the query field. When you are done typing, simply hit kbd:[Enter]

.Simple Ceph Query
image::metrics-simplecephquery.png[Ceph Simple Query]

The window should refresh with a graph similar to the one below.

.Simple Ceph Graph
image::metrics-simplecephgraph.png[Ceph Simple Graph]

Then let's try a more relevant query example and enter the following text `rate(ceph_osd_op[5m])` or `irate(ceph_osd_op[5m])` in the query field. When you are done typing, simply hit kbd:[Enter]

.Complex Ceph Query
image::metrics-complexcephquery.png[Ceph Complex Query]

The window should refresh with a graph similar to the one below.

.Complex Ceph Graph
image::metrics-complexcephgraph.png[Ceph Complex Graph]

All OCP metrics are also available through the integrated *Metrics* window. Feel free to try with any of the OCP related metrics such as `process_cpu_seconds_total` for example.

.Complex OCP Graph
image::metrics-complexocpgraph.png[OCP Complex Graph]

NOTE: Have a look at the difference between `sum(irate(process_cpu_seconds_total[5m]))` and `irate(process_cpu_seconds_total[5m])` for instance.

[NOTE]

== Using must-gather

Must-gather is a tool for collecting data about the current'y running Openshift cluster. It loads a predefined set of containers that execute multiple programs and dump it on the local workstations filesystem.
The local files can then be used by a remote support engineer to debug a problem more easily without needing direct cluster access. This is similar to sosreports for RHEL hosts.

The OCS team has released its own image for the must-gather tool that runs storage specific commands.

You can run this diagnostic tool like this for generic Openshift debugging:

[source,role="execute"]
----
oc adm must-gather
----

Or like this for OCS specific insights:

[source,role="execute"]
----
oc adm must-gather --image=quay.io/rhceph-dev/ocs-must-gather
----

The output will then be saved in the current directory inside of a new folder called `must-gather.local.(random)`

More runtime options can be displayed with this command:

[source,role="execute"]
----
oc adm must-gather -h
----
.Example output:
----
Launch a pod to gather debugging information

 This command will launch a pod in a temporary namespace on your cluster that gathers debugging information and then
downloads the gathered information.

 Experimental: This command is under active development and may change without notice.

Usage:
  oc adm must-gather [flags]

Examples:
  # gather information using the default plug-in image and command, writing into ./must-gather.local.<rand>
  oc adm must-gather

  # gather information with a specific local folder to copy to
  oc adm must-gather --dest-dir=/local/directory

  # gather information using multiple plug-in images
  oc adm must-gather --image=quay.io/kubevirt/must-gather --image=quay.io/openshift/origin-must-gather

  # gather information using a specific image stream plug-in
  oc adm must-gather --image-stream=openshift/must-gather:latest

  # gather information using a specific image, command, and pod-dir
  oc adm must-gather --image=my/image:tag --source-dir=/pod/directory -- myspecial-command.sh

Options:
      --dest-dir='': Set a specific directory on the local machine to write gathered data to.
      --image=[]: Specify a must-gather plugin image to run. If not specified, OpenShift's default must-gather image
will be used.

== Configuring the local oc client

This section will explain how you set up your workstation with the Openshift CLI.

To get the latest OpenShift CLI client run the following commands:


.Mac steps
[source]
----
wget https://mirror.openshift.com/pub/openshift-v4/clients/ocp/latest/ --no-directories --accept="*client-mac*" --quiet --recursive --level=1
ls -1 openshift-client-mac-*.tar.gz | tail -n1 | xargs -I {} tar xzvf {} oc
sudo mv oc /usr/local/bin
----

In addition install the watch command to use with the `oc client` on your Mac using Homebrew.

----
brew install watch
----
Alternatively, add the following lines to your $HOME/.profile.

----
function watch {
while :; do clear; date; echo; $@; sleep 2; done
}
----

Then reload your profile with `source $HOME/.profile`.

.Linux steps
[source]
----
wget https://mirror.openshift.com/pub/openshift-v4/clients/ocp/latest/ --no-directories --accept="*client-linux*" --quiet --recursive --level=1
ls -1 openshift-client-linux-*.tar.gz | tail -n1 | xargs -I {} tar xzvf {} oc
sudo mv oc /usr/bin
----

Afterwards, go to your Openshift Web Console, log in and click on the username in the top right corner. There you will find the menu item `Copy Login Command`.

.Copy Login command menu entry
image::OCP-copy-login-command.png[]

Clicking on `Copy Login Command` will open a new window and you might be required to login to your Openshift cluster again.
After successfully login in, you see blue text `Display token` - click this and you will be shown your login command.

The login command will look similar to this

`oc login --token=zoNoANLOOoJzXV3sb-TE1xIcg2aLBssdN0bTNIuV29w --server=https://api.cluster-ocs-89db.ocs-89db.example.opentlc.com:6443`

execute this login command on your terminal. If you did not provision your RHPDS environment with Let's Encrypt certificates, it will ask if you want to connect without certificate checks, accept this.

Check if you are successfully connected by issuing a command against the cluster:

[source,role="execute"]
----
oc version
----
.Example output:
----
Client Version: openshift-clients-4.2.0-201910041700
Server Version: 4.2.0
Kubernetes Version: v1.14.6+2e5ed54
----

[NOTE]
====
The above commands will always pull the latest oc version, so your version might be higher than the version in the example output.
====

[appendix]

[appendix]
== Introduction to Ceph

This section will go through Ceph fundamental knowledge for a better understanding of the underlying storage solution
used by OCS 4.

[NOTE]
====
The content in this Appendix is relevant to learning about the critical components of Ceph and how Ceph works. OCS 4 uses Ceph in a prescribed manner for providing storage to OpenShift applications. Using *Operators* and *CustomResourceDefinitions* (CRDs) for deploying and managing OCS 4 may restrict some of Ceph's advanced features when compared to general use outside of OCP 4.
====

[.lead]
*Timeline*

The Ceph project has a long history as you can see in the timeline below.

.Ceph Project History
image::ceph101-timeline.png[Ceph Project Timeline]

[.lead]
It is a battle-tested software defined storage (SDS) solution that has been available as a storage backend for OpenStack and Kubernetes for quite some time.

[.lead]
*Architecture*

The Ceph cluster provides a scalable storage solution while providing multiple access methods to enable the different types of
clients present within the IT infrastructure to get access to the data.

.Ceph Architecture
image::ceph101-overview.png[Ceph From Above]

[.lead]
The entire Ceph architecture is resilient and does not present any single point of failure (SPOF).

[.lead]
*RADOS*

The heart of Ceph is an object store known as RADOS (Reliable Autonomic Distributed Object Store) bottom layer on the screen. This
layer provides the Ceph software defined storage with the ability to store data (serve IO requests, to protect the data, to check
the consistency and the integrity of the data through built-in mechanisms. The RADOS layer is composed of the following daemons:

1. MONs or Monitors
2. OSDs or Object Storage Devices
3. MGRs or Managers
4. MDSs or Meta Data Servers

.*_Monitors_*
The Monitors maintain the cluster map and state and provide distributed decision-making while configured in an odd number, 3 or 5 depending
on the size and the topology of the cluster, to prevent split-brain situations. The Monitors are not in the data-path and do not serve IO
requests to and from the clients.

.*_OSDs_*
One OSD is typically deployed for each local block devices and the native scalable nature of Ceph allows for thousands of OSDs to be part of the cluster.
The OSDs are serving IO requests from the clients while guaranteeing the protection of the data (replication or erasure coding), the rebalancing of the data
in case of an OSD or a node failure, the coherence of the data (scrubbing and deep-scrubbing of the existing data).

.*_MGRs_*
The Managers are tightly integrated with the Monitors and collect the statistics within the cluster. Additionally they provide an extensible framework for the
cluster through a pluggable Python interface aimed at expanding the Ceph existing capabilities. The current list of modules developed around the Manager framework
are:

* Balancer module
* Placement Group auto-scaler module
* Dashboard module
* RESTful module
* Prometheus module
* Zabbix module
* Rook module

.*_MDSs_*
The Meta Data Servers manage the metadata for the POSIX compliant shared filesystem such as the directory hierarchy and the file metadata (ownership, timestamps, mode, ...).
All the metadata is stored with RADOS and they do not server any data to the clients. MDSs are only deployed when a shared filesystem is configured in the Ceph cluster.

If we look at the Ceph cluster foundation layer, the full picture with the different types of daemons or containers looks like this.

.RADOS as it stands
image::ceph101-rados.png[RADOS Overview]

The circle represent the MONs, the 'M' represent the MGRs and the squares with the bars represent the OSDs. In the diagram above, the cluster operates with
3 Monitors, 2 Managers and 23 OSDs.

[.lead]
*Access Methods*

Ceph was designed to provides the IT environment with all the necessary access methods so that any application can use what is the best solution for its use-case.

.Different Storage Types Supported
image::ceph101-differentstoragetypes.png[Ceph Access Modes]

Ceph supports block storage through the RADOS Block Device (aka RBD) access method, file storage through the Ceph Filesystem (aka CephFS) access method and
object storage through its native `librados` API or through the RADOS Gateway (aka RADOSGW or RGW) for compatibility with the S3 and Swift protocols.

[.lead]
*Librados*

Librados allows developers to code natively against the native Ceph cluster API for maximum efficiency combined with a small footprint.

.Application Native Object API
image::ceph101-librados.png[librados]

The Ceph native API offers different wrappers such as C, C++, Python, Java, Ruby, Erlang, Go and Rust.

[.lead]
*RADOS Block Device (RBD)*

This access method is used in Red Hat Enterprise Linux or OpenShift version 3.x or 4.x. RBDs can be accessed either through a kernel module (RHEL, OCS4)
or through the `librbd` API (RHOSP). In the OCP world, RBDs are designed to address the need for RWO PVCs.

[.lead]
*_Kernel Module (kRBD)_*

The kernel RBD driver offers superior performance compared to the userspace `librbd` method. However, kRBD is currently limited and does
not provide the same level of functionality. e.g., no RBD Mirroring support.

.kRBD Diagram
image::ceph101-krbd.png[Kernel based RADOS Block Device]

[.lead]
*_Userspace RBD (librbd)_*

This access method is used in Red Hat OpenStack Environment or OpenShift through the RBD-NBD driver when available starting in the RHEL 8.1 kernel.
This mode allows us to leverage all existing RBD features such as RBD Mirroring.

.librbd Diagram
image::ceph101-librbd.png[Userspace RADOS Block Device]

[.lead]
*_Shared Filesystem (CephFS)_*

This method allows clients to jointly access a shared POSIX compliant filesystem. The client initially contacts the Meta Data Server to obtain
the location of the object(s) for a given inode and then communicates directly with an OSD to perform the final IO request.

.File Access (Ceph Filesystem or CephFS)
image::ceph101-cephfs.png[Kernel Based CephFS Client]

CephFS is typically used for RWX claims but can also be used to support RWO claims.

[.lead]
*_Object Storage, S3 and Swift (Ceph RADOS Gateway)_*

This access method offers support for the Amazon S3 and OpenStack Swift support on top of a Ceph cluster. The Openshift Container Storage Multi Cloud
Gateway can leverage the RADOS Gateway to support Object Bucket Claims. From the Multi Cloud Gateway perspective the RADOS Gateway will be tagged
as a compatible S3 endpoint.

.Amazone S3 or OpenStack Swift (Ceph RADOS Gateway)
image::ceph101-rgw.png[S3 and Swift Support]

[.lead]
*CRUSH*

The Ceph cluster being a distributed architecture some solution had to be designed to provide an efficient way to distribute the data across the multiple
OSDs in the cluster. The technique used is called CRUSH or Controlled Replication Under Scalable Hashing. With CRUSH, every object is assigned to one
and only one hash bucket known as a Placement Group (PG).

image::ceph101-crushfromobjecttoosd.png[From Object to OSD]

CRUSH is the central point of configuration for the topology of the cluster. It offers a pseudo-random placement algorithm to distribute the objects across
the PGs and uses rules to determine the mapping of the PGs to the OSDs. In essence, the PGs are an abstraction layer between the objects (application layer)
and the OSDs (physical layer). In case of failure, the PGs will be remapped to different physical devices (OSDs) and eventually see their content resynchronized
to match the protection rules  selected by the storage administrator.

[.lead]
*Cluster Partitioning*

The Ceph OSDs will be in charge of the protection of the data as well as the constant checking of the integrity of the data stored in the entire cluster.
The cluster will be separated into logical partitions, known as pools. Each pool has the following properties that can be adjusted:

* An ID (immutable)
* A name
* A number of PGs to distribute the objects across the OSDs
* A CRUSH rule to determine the mapping of the PGs for this pool
* A type of protection (Replication or Erasure Coding)
* Parameters associated with the type of protection
** Number of copies for replicated pools
** K and M chunks for Erasure Coding
* Various flags to influence the behavior of the cluster

[.lead]
*Pools and PGs*

.Pools and PGs
image::ceph101-thefullpicture.png[From Object to OSD]

The diagram above shows the relationship end to end between the object at the access method level down to the OSDs at the physical layer.

[NOTE]
====
A Ceph pool has no size and is able to consume the space available any OSD where its PGs are created. A Placement Group or PG belongs to only one pool.
====

[.lead]
*Data Protection*

Ceph supports two types of data protection presented in the diagram below.

.Ceph Data Protection
image::ceph101-dataprotection.png[Replicated Pools vs Erasure Coded Pools]

Replicated pools provide better performance in almost all cases at the cost of a lower usable to raw storage ratio (1 usable byte is stored using 3 bytes of raw storage)
while `Erasure Coding` provides a cost efficient way to store data with less performance. Red Hat supports the following `Erasure Coding` profiles with their corresponding usable to raw ratio:

* 4+2 (1:2 ratio)
* 8+3 (1:1.375 ratio)
* 8+4 (1:2 ratio)

Another advantage of `Erasure Coding` (EC) is its ability to offer extreme resilience and durability as we can configure the number of parities being used.
EC can be used for the RADOS Gateway access method and for the RBD access method (performance impact).

[.lead]
*Data Distribution*

To leverage the Ceph architecture at its best, all access methods but librados, will access the data in the cluster through a collection of objects. Hence a 1GB
block device will be a collection of objects, each supporting a set of device sectors. Therefore, a 1GB file is stored in a CephFS directory will be split into multiple objects. Also a 5GB S3 object stored through the RADOS Gateway via the Multi Cloud Gateway will be divided in multiple objects.

.Data Distribution
image::ceph101-rbdlayout.png[RADOS Block Device Layout]

[NOTE]
====
By default, each access method uses an object size of 4MB. The above diagram details how a 32MB RBD (Block Device) supporting a RWO PVC will be scattered throughout the cluster.
