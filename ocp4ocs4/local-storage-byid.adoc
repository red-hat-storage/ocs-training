== Installing OpenShift Container Storage Operator using Operator Hub

Start with creating the `openshift-storage` namespace.

[source,role="execute"]
----
oc create namespace openshift-storage
----

You must add the monitoring label to this namespace. This is required to get prometheus metrics and alerts for the OCP storage dashboards. To label the `openshift-storage` namespace use the following command:

[source,role="execute"]
----
oc label namespace openshift-storage "openshift.io/cluster-monitoring=true"
----

// [IMPORTANT]
// ====
// If deploying an OCS pre-release version, *skip* the steps above to create openshift-storage namespace. Instead use https://raw.githubusercontent.com/red-hat-storage/ocs-training/ocs-eap/ocp4ocs4/deploy-with-olm.yaml[deploy-with-olm.yaml] and execute `oc create -f deploy-with-olm.yaml`.
// 
// .Example output:
// ----
// namespace/openshift-storage created
// operatorgroup.operators.coreos.com/openshift-storage-operatorgroup created
// catalogsource.operators.coreos.com/ocs-catalogsource created
// catalogsource.operators.coreos.com/lib-bucket-catalogsource created
// ----
// ====

Now switch over to your *OpenShift Web Console*. You can get your URL by issuing command below to get the OCP 4 `console` route.

[source,role="execute"]
----
oc get -n openshift-console route console
----

Once you are logged in, navigate to the *OperatorHub* menu.

.OCP OperatorHub
image::OCS-OCP-OperatorHub.png[OCP OperatorHub]

Now type `openshift container storage` in the *Filter by _keyword..._* box.

.OCP OperatorHub filter on OpenShift Container Storage Operator
image::OCS4-OCP-OperatorHub-Filter.png[OCP OperatorHub Filter]

Select `OpenShift Container Storage Operator` and then select *Install*.

On the next screen make sure the settings are as shown in this figure. Also, make sure to change to `A specific namespace on the cluster` and chose namespace `openshift-storage`.

.OCP Subscribe to OpenShift Container Storage
image::OCS4-OCP-OperatorHub-Subscribe.png[OCP OperatorHub Subscribe]

NOTE: Do not change any configuration other than the namespace as shown above.

Click `Subscribe`.

Now you can go back to your terminal window to check the progress of the installation.

[source,role="execute"]
----
watch oc -n openshift-storage get csv
----
.Example output:
----
NAME                            DISPLAY                       VERSION   REPLACES   PHASE

ocs-operator.v4.4.0             OpenShift Container Storage   4.4.0                Succeeded
----

You can exit by pressing kbd:[Ctrl+C]

The resource `csv` is a shortened word for `clusterserviceversions.operators.coreos.com`.

.Please wait until both operators `PHASE` changes to `Succeeded`
CAUTION: Reaching this state can take several minutes.

You will now also see operator pods have been started in the `openshift-storage` namespace:

[source,role="execute"]
----
oc -n openshift-storage get pods
----
.Example output:
----
NAME                                      READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
lib-bucket-provisioner-55f74d96f6-mkrz2   1/1     Running   0          3m48s
noobaa-operator-68c8fbdff5-kgxxt          1/1     Running   0          3m41s
ocs-operator-78d98758db-dwc8h             1/1     Running   0          3m41s
rook-ceph-operator-55cb44fcfc-wxppc       1/1     Running   0          3m41s
----

Navigate to the `Operators` menu on the left and select `Installed Operators`. Make sure the selected project at the top of the UI pane is set to `openshift-storage`. What you see should be similar to the following example:

image::OCP4-installed-operators.png[Openshift showing the installed operators in namespace openshift-storage]

Now that the operator pods are running, you can create a Storage Cluster.

== Installing OpenShift Container Storage on Local Storage Devices

Use this procedure to install OpenShift Container Storage (OCS) on bare metal, Amazon EC2, and VMware infrastructures where OpenShift Container Platform 4 (OCP) is already installed.

[NOTE]
====
The following sections use YAML files and CLI to create resources used to deploy OCS 4 on local storage devices. In future releases of OCP 4 and OCS 4 these operations will have the option of being done using the *Openshift Web Console* UI making using local storage easier and less error prone.
====

[IMPORTANT]
====
Installing OpenShift Container Storage Amazon EC2 using local storage operator is a Technology Preview feature. Technology Preview features are not supported with Red Hat production service level agreements (SLAs) and might not be functionally complete. Red Hat does not recommend using them in production. These features provide early access to upcoming product features, enabling customers to test functionality and provide feedback during the development process.
====

=== Prerequisites

* You must have at least 3 OCP worker nodes in the cluster with locally attached storage devices on each of them.
* Each worker node must have a minimum of 12 CPUs and 64 GB Memory.
* Each of the 3 worker nodes must have at least one available raw block device available to be used by OCS (e.g., 100 GB size).
* You must have a minimum of three labeled worker nodes.

** Each OCP worker node must have a specific label to deploy OCS *Pods*. To label the nodes use the following command:

[source,role="execute"]
----
oc label node <NodeName> cluster.ocs.openshift.io/openshift-storage=''
----

NOTE: Make sure to add this label to all OCP workers that have local storage devices to be used by OCS.

* No other storage providers managing locally mounted storage on the storage nodes should be present that will conflict with the Local Storage Operator (LSO).

==== Label Verification

Amazon EC2 zone and region topology labels are dynamically applied to OCP nodes by the AWS Cloud Provider. In VMware or bare metal environments, rack topology labels can be applied by a cluster administrator prior to OCS being deployed. OCS inspects zone and rack topology labels and uses them to inform placement policies for data availability and durability.

[NOTE]
====
OCS requires at least three failure domains for data safety and the domains should be *symmetrical* in terms of node quantity. If the OCP nodes used for the OCS deployment do not have preexisting topology labels OCS will generate three virtual racks using `topology.rook.io/rack` topology labels.
====

The following command will output a list of nodes with the OCS label, and print a column for each of the topology labels OCS takes into consideration.

[source,role="execute"]
----
oc get nodes -L failure-domain.beta.kubernetes.io/zone,failure-domain.beta.kubernetes.io/rack,failure-domain.kubernetes.io/zone,failure-domain.kubernetes.io/rack -l cluster.ocs.openshift.io/openshift-storage=''
----

If the output from this command does not print *any* topology labels, then it is safe to proceed.

If the output from this command shows at least three existing unique topology labels (eg. three different racks, or three different zones), then it is safe to proceed.

If there are existing rack labels *and* there are less than 3 different values (e.g., 2 nodes in rack1 and 1 node in rack2 only), then different nodes should be labeled for OCS.

=== Installing the Local Storage Operator

Start with creating the `local-storage` namespace.

[source,role="execute"]
----
oc new-project local-storage
----

Now switch over to your *Openshift Web Console* and select *OperatorHub*. Type `local storage` in the *Filter by _keyword..._* box.

image::OCP4-LSO-filter.png[OperatorHub LSO Operator filter]

Select `Local Storage Operator` and then select *Install*.

On the next screen make sure the settings are as shown in this figure. Also, make sure to change to `A specific namespace on the cluster` and chose namespace `local-storage`.

.OCP Subscribe to Local Storage Operator
image::OCS4-OCP-OperatorHub-LSO-Subscribe.png[OCP OperatorHub Subscribe]

NOTE: Do not change any configuration other than the namespace as shown above.

Click `Subscribe`.

Now you can go back to your terminal window to check the progress of the installation.

[source,role="execute"]
----
oc -n local-storage get pods
----
.Example output:
----
NAME                                     READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
local-storage-operator-765dc5b87-vfh69   1/1     Running   0          23s
----

The Local Storage Operator (LSO) has been successfully installed. Now move on to creating local persistent volumes (PVs) on the storage nodes using LocalVolume Custom Resource (CR) files.

=== Finding Available Storage Devices

Using LSO to create *PVs* can be done for bare metal, Amazon EC2, or VMware storage devices. What you must know is the exact device name on each of the 3 or more OCP worker nodes you labeled with OCS label `cluster.ocs.openshift.io/openshift-storage=''`. The method to do this is to logon to each node and verify the device names as well, the size of each device, and that the device is available.

Logon to each worker node that will be used for OCS resources and find the unique `by-id` device name for each available raw block device. You will want to copy these values to a clipboard for the next step.

[source,role="execute"]
----
oc debug node/<NodeName>
----

.Example output:
----
oc debug node/ip-10-0-135-71.us-east-2.compute.internal

nvme1n1                      259:1    0   1.7T  0 disk
----

After you know which local devices are available, in this case `nvme0n1` and `nvme1n1`, you can now find the `by-id`, a unique name depending on the hardware serial number for each device.

----
sh-4.4# ls -l /dev/disk/by-id/

----

In this case the EC2 instance type is i3.4xlarge so we know all 3 worker nodes are the same type of machine but their `by-id` identifier is unique for every local device. As shown above, the results of `lsblk` shows the last 2 devices `nvme0n1` and `nvme1n1` are available with a size of 1.7 TB.

For each worker node that has the OCS label (minimum 3) you will need to find the unique `by-id`. For this node they are:

* `nvme-Amazon_EC2_NVMe_Instance_Storage_AWS10382E5D7441494EC`
* `nvme-Amazon_EC2_NVMe_Instance_Storage_AWS60382E5D7441494EC`

This example just shows results for one node so this method needs to be repeated for the other nodes that have storage devices to be used by OCS. 

The next sections will detail how to create and validate the OCS *StorageCluster* using Amazon EC2, VMware, and bare metal local storage devices.

=== Creating the OCS Storage Cluster on AWS

The next step is to create the LSO LocalVolume CR which in turn will create *PVs* and a new *StorageClass* for creating Ceph storage. For this example only device `nvme0n1` will be used on each node using the `by-id` unique identifier in the CR.

Before you create this resource make sure you have labeled your OCP worker nodes with the OCS label.

[source,role="execute"]
----
oc get nodes -l cluster.ocs.openshift.io/openshift-storage -o jsonpath='{range .items[*]}{.metadata.name}{"\n"}'
----
.Example output:
----
ip-10-0-135-71.us-east-2.compute.internal
ip-10-0-145-125.us-east-2.compute.internal
ip-10-0-160-91.us-east-2.compute.internal
----

Now that you know a minimum of 3 nodes are labeled you can proceed. The label is important because it is used as the `nodeSelector` below.

[source,yaml]
.LocalVolume CR local-storage-block.yaml using OCS label as Node Selector and `by-id` device identifier:
----
apiVersion: local.storage.openshift.io/v1
kind: LocalVolume
metadata:

  namespace: local-storage
spec:

    nodeSelectorTerms:
    - matchExpressions:
        - key: cluster.ocs.openshift.io/openshift-storage
          operator: In
          values:
          - ""
  storageClassDevices:
    - storageClassName: localblock
      volumeMode: Block
      devicePaths:
        - /dev/disk/by-id/nvme-Amazon_EC2_NVMe_Instance_Storage_AWS10382E5D7441494EC   # <-- modify this line
        - /dev/disk/by-id/nvme-Amazon_EC2_NVMe_Instance_Storage_AWS1F45C01D7E84FE3E9   # <-- modify this line
        - /dev/disk/by-id/nvme-Amazon_EC2_NVMe_Instance_Storage_AWS136BC945B4ECB9AE4   # <-- modify this line
----

Create this LocalVolume CR using the following command:

[source,role="execute"]
----
oc create -f local-storage-block.yaml
----
.Example output:
----
localvolume.local.storage.openshift.io/local-block created
----

Now that the CR is created let's see the results.

[source,role="execute"]
----
oc -n local-storage get pods
----
.Example output:
----
NAME                                     READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE

local-storage-operator-765dc5b87-vfh69   1/1     Running   0          53m
----

There should now be a new *PV* for each of the local storage devices on the 3 worker nodes. Remember when we checked above there were 2 available storage devices per worker node. Only device `nvme0n1` was used on each worker node and the size is 1.7 TB.

[source,role="execute"]
----
oc get pv
----
.Example output:
----

----

And finally we should have an additional *StorageClass* as a result of creating this LocalVolume CR. This *StorageClass* will be used when creating *PVCs* in the next step of creating a *StorageCluster*.

[source,role="execute"]
----
oc get sc
----
.Example output:
----

localblock      kubernetes.io/no-provisioner   7m46s
----

For Amazon EC2 instance that have local storage devices (e.g., i3.4xlarge) we need to create a *StorageCluster* Custom Resource (CR) that will use the `localblock` *StorageClass* and 3 *PVs* created in the previous section.

[source,yaml]
.StorageCluster CR cluster-service-AWS.yaml using `gp2` and `localblock` storageclasses:

    portable: false
    replica: 3
    resources: {}
----

[IMPORTANT]
====
The `storage` size for *storageDeviceSets* must be less than or equal to the size of the raw block devices. Setting the value to `1` will guarantee that this requirement is met.
====

Create this StorageCluster CR using the following command:

Reference <<Validating the successful OCS Cluster creation>> for how to validate your *StorageCluster* deployment.

=== Creating the OCS Storage Cluster on VMware

The process for using local storage devices for OCP on VMware environments is very similar but has some differences. The first is the types of local storage that is supported for VMware. The 3 types are the following:

* VMDK
* Raw Device Mapping (RDM)
* VMDirectPath

In order to use local storage devices on VMware you must have a minimum of 3 worker nodes with the `same` storage type attached to each node.

Once this has been done you can use a similar method as done for AWS by logging on to the OCP worker nodes with the OCS label (see <<Prerequisites>>) and issuing a `lsblk`. By inspecting the results of this command you will know which devices are available and what the size of each device is (e.g., /dev/sdb is 100 GB). See <<Finding Available Storage Devices>> for more details.

For Monitor storage in the StorageCluster CR use *monDataDirHostPath* and set its value to /var/lib/rook.

Now create the LocalVolume CR for Block *PVs*.

[source,yaml]
.LocalVolume CR local-storage-block.yaml using OCS label as Node Selector:

----

Create this LocalVolume CR for Block *PVs* using the following command:

[source,role="execute"]
----
oc create -f local-storage-block.yaml
----

Check for the new `localblock` *StorageClass*.

[source,role="execute"]
----
oc get sc | grep localblock

----

After the new *StorageClasses* are created there will be new *PVs* with `Available` status.

[source,role="execute"]
----
oc get get pv
----
.Example output:

----

The last step for using local storage on VMware is to create the *StorageCluster*. This is again very similar to how it was done for AWS but with a few changes.

[source,yaml]

=== Creating the OCS Storage Cluster on Bare Metal

The process for using local storage devices for OCP on bare methal environments is very similar to both AWS and VMware environments with some differences.

In order to use local storage devices on bare metal servers you must have a minimum of 3 worker nodes. Each of the machines must have at least one raw block device and the `same` storage type attached to each node (.e.g., 2TB NVMe drive).

To identify the storage devices on each node use the same method as the one used for AWS and VMWare environments by logging on to each OCS worker node and issuing a lsblk command. By inspecting the results of this command you will know which devices are available and their size. See <<Finding Available Storage Devices>> for more details.

For Monitor storage in the StorageCluster CR use *monDataDirHostPath* and set its value to /var/lib/rook.

First step is to create the LocalVolume CR for Block *PVs*.

[source,yaml]
.LocalVolume CR local-storage-block.yaml using OCS label as Node Selector:

----

Create this LocalVolume CR for Block *PVs* using the following command:

[source,role="execute"]
----
oc create -f local-storage-file.yaml
----

Check for the new `localblock` *StorageClass*.

[source,role="execute"]
----
oc get sc | grep localblock
----
.Example output:
----

----

The last step for using local storage on bare metal servers is to create the *StorageCluster*. This is again very similar to how it was done for AWS and VMware.

[source,yaml]
.StorageCluster CR cluster-service-metal.yaml using `monDataDirHostPath` and `localblock` storageclass:
----
apiVersion: ocs.openshift.io/v1
kind: StorageCluster
metadata:
  name: ocs-storagecluster

  storageDeviceSets:

        volumeMode: Block
    name: ocs-deviceset
    placement: {}
    portable: false
    replica: 3
    resources: {}
----

[IMPORTANT]
====
The `storage` size for *storageDeviceSets* must be less than or equal to the size of the raw block devices. Setting the value to `1` for both will guarantee that this requirement is met.

=== Validating the successful OCS Cluster creation

Once the *StorageCluster* is created OCS pods will start showing up in the `openshift-storage` namespace. For the deployment to completely finish could take up to 10 minutes so be patient. Below you will find examples of a successful deployment of the OCS *Pods* and *PVCs*.

If it says `Ready` you can continue on to using OCS storage for applications.

== Scaling out Storage by adding Nodes to OpenShift Container Storage

You must have three OCP worker nodes with the same storage type and size attached to each node (for example, 2TB NVMe drive) as the original OCS *StorageCluster* was created with. 

* Each OCP worker node must have a specific label to deploy OCS *Pods*. To label the nodes use the following command:

[source,role="execute"]
----
oc label node <NodeName> cluster.ocs.openshift.io/openshift-storage=''
----

Once the new nodes are labeled you are ready to add the new local storage device(s) available in these new worker nodes to the OCS *StorageCluster*. Follow the process in the <<Scaling up Storage by adding Devices to OpenShift Container Storage, next section>> to create new *PVs* and increase the number of Ceph OSDs. The new OSDs (3 minimum) most likely will be scheduled by OpenShift on the new worker nodes with the OCS label.

== Scaling up Storage by adding Devices to OpenShift Container Storage

Use this procedure to add storage capacity (additional storage devices) to your configured Red Hat OpenShift Container Storage worker nodes.

To add storage capacity to existing OCP nodes with OCS installed, you will need to find the unique `by-id` identifier for available devices that you want to add, a minimum of one device per worker node. See <<Finding Available Storage Devices>> for more details. Make sure to do this process for all existing nodes (minimum of 3) that you want to add storage to.

Reference <<Validating the successful OCS Storage Cluster creation on AWS>> for how to validate your *StorageCluster* deployment.

== Replacing a Failed Device with OpenShift Container Storage

This process should be followed when an OSD *Pod* is in an `Error` state and the root cause is a failed underlying storage device.

Login to *OpenShift Web Console* and view the storage Dashboard.

.OCP Storage Dashboard status after OSD failed
image::OCS4-OCP-Dashboard-Status-Bad.png[OCP Storage Dashboard status]

[NOTE]
====
Make sure to have the Rook-Ceph `toolbox` *Pod* available. Instructions for deploying the `toolbox` can be found in <<Using the Rook-Ceph toolbox to Validate Ceph backing storage>>.
====

=== Removing failed OSD from Ceph cluster
The first step is to identify the OCP node that has the bad OSD scheduled on it. In this example it is OCP node `compute-2`.

The following process will remove the *down* OSD from the cluster so a new OSD can be added.

[source,role="execute"]
----
ceph osd out {osd-id}
----
.Example output
----

----

After the OSD is marked out the `OSD REWEIGHT RATIO` is set to `zero`. This will cause the data to migrate from this OSD to the remaining OSDs.

[CAUTION]
====
In the case of only three OSDs the data cannot migrate because there is only one OSD in each of the 3 availability zones and only 2 OSDs are operational.

=== Delete PVC resources associated with failed OSD

First the *DeviceSet* must be identified that is associated with the failed OSD. In this example the *PVC* name is `ocs-deviceset-0-0-nvs68`.

[source,role="execute"]
----
oc get -o yaml -n openshift-storage deployment rook-ceph-osd-{osd-id} | grep ceph.rook.io/pvc
----
.Example output
----
ceph.rook.io/pvc: ocs-deviceset-0-0-nvs68
ceph.rook.io/pvc: ocs-deviceset-0-0-nvs68
----

Scale down failed OSD *deployment* to `replicas=0`. In this example the deployment name is `rook-ceph-osd-0`.

[source,role="execute"]
----
oc scale -n openshift-storage deployment rook-ceph-osd-{osd-id} --replicas=0
----
.Example output
----
deployment.extensions/rook-ceph-osd-0 scaled
----

Now identify the *PV* associated with the *PVC* identified earlier. In this example the associated *PV* is `local-pv-d9c5cbd6`.

[source,role="execute"]
----
oc get -n openshift-storage pvc ocs-deviceset-0-0-nvs68
----
.Example output
----

----

Now the failed device name needs to be identified. In this example the device name is `sdb`.

[source,role="execute"]
----
oc get pv local-pv-d9c5cbd6 -o yaml | grep path
----
.Example output
----
path: /mnt/local-storage/localblock/sdb
----

The next step is to identify the `prepare-pod` associated with the failed OSD.

[source,role="execute"]
----
oc describe -n openshift-storage pvc ocs-deviceset-0-0-nvs68 | grep Mounted
----
.Example output
----
Mounted By:    rook-ceph-osd-prepare-ocs-deviceset-0-0-nvs68-zblp7
----

This `prepare-pod` must be deleted before the associated *PVC* can be removed.

[source,role="execute"]
----
oc delete -n openshift-storage pod rook-ceph-osd-prepare-ocs-deviceset-0-0-nvs68-zblp7
----
.Example output
----
pod "rook-ceph-osd-prepare-ocs-deviceset-0-0-nvs68-zblp7" deleted
----

Now the *PVC* associated with the failed OSD can be deleted.

[source,role="execute"]
----
oc delete -n openshift-storage pvc -n openshift-storage ocs-deviceset-0-0-nvs68
----
.Example output
----
persistentvolumeclaim "ocs-deviceset-0-0-nvs68" deleted
----

=== Replace failed drive and create new PV

After the *PVC* associated with the failed drive is deleted, it is time to replace the failed drive and use this new drive to create a new OCP *PV*.

First step is to login to the OCP node with the failed drive and record the `/dev/disk/by-id/{id}` that is to be replaced. In this example the OCP node is `compute-2`.

[source,role="execute"]
----
oc debug node/compute-2
----
.Example output
----
Starting pod/compute-2-debug ...
To use host binaries, run `chroot /host`
Pod IP: 10.70.56.66

----

Using the device name identified earlier, `sdb`, record the `/dev/disk/by-id/{id}` for use in the next step.

----

Now identify the `/dev/disk/by-id/{id}` for the new drive and record for use in the next step.

----
sh-4.2# ls -alh /dev/disk/by-id | grep sdd
----
.Example output
----

After the new `/dev/disk/by-id/{id}` is available a new disk entry can be added to the *LocalVolume* CR.  

[source,role="execute"]
----
oc get -n local-storage localvolume
----
.Example output
----

Next step is to delete the *deployment* for the failed OSD *Pod*. This *deployment* was scaled to `replicas=0` in an earlier step. 

[source,role="execute"]
----
oc get -n openshift-storage deployments | grep osd
----
.Example output
----
rook-ceph-osd-0                                      0/0     0            0           1d20h
rook-ceph-osd-1                                      1/1     1            1           1d20h
rook-ceph-osd-2                                      1/1     1            1           1d20h
----

For this example the deployment name is `rook-ceph-osd-0`.

[source,role="execute"]
----
oc delete -n openshift-storage deployment rook-ceph-osd-{osd-id}
----
.Example output
----
deployment.extensions "rook-ceph-osd-0" deleted
----

Now that the *deployment* and all other associated OCP and Ceph resources for the failed device are deleted or removed, the new OSD can be deployed. This is done by restarting the `rook-ceph-operator` to force operator reconciliation. 

[source,role="execute"]
----
oc get -n openshift-storage pod -l app=rook-ceph-operator
----
.Example output
----
NAME                                  READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
rook-ceph-operator-6f74fb5bff-2d982   1/1     Running   0          1d20h
----

Now delete the `rook-ceph-operator`.

[source,role="execute"]
----
oc -n openshift-storage delete pod rook-ceph-operator-6f74fb5bff-2d982
----
.Example output
----
pod "rook-ceph-operator-6f74fb5bff-2d982" deleted
----

Now validate the `rook-ceph-operator` *Pod* is restarted.

[source,role="execute"]
----
oc get -n openshift-storage pod -l app=rook-ceph-operator
----
.Example output
----
NAME                                  READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
rook-ceph-operator-6f74fb5bff-7mvrq   1/1     Running   0          66s
----

Last step is to validate there is a new OSD, that Ceph is healthy, and that a successful replacement shows in the *OpenShift Web Console* Dashboards. 

[source,role="execute"]
----
oc -n openshift-storage get pods | grep osd | grep -v prepare
----
.Example output
----
rook-ceph-osd-0-5f7f4747d4-snshw                                  1/1     Running     0          4m47s
rook-ceph-osd-1-85d99fb95f-2svc7                                  1/1     Running     0          1d20h
rook-ceph-osd-2-6c66cdb977-jp542                                  1/1     Running     0          1d20h
----

There now is a OSD that was redeployed with a similar name, `rook-ceph-osd-0`. 

Next step is to login to Ceph and see if the cluster is healthy.

We can see the Ceph health is `HEALTH_OK`.

You can now exit the toolbox by either pressing kbd:[Ctrl+D] or by executing

[source,role="execute"]
----
exit
----

Now login to *OpenShift Web Console* and view the storage Dashboard.

== Using the Rook-Ceph toolbox to Validate Ceph backing storage

Starting with OpenShift Container Storage 4.3 the deployment of a *toolbox* can be created by modifying the *CustomResource* `OCSInitialization`.

You can either patch the `OCSInitialization ocsinit` using the following command line:

[source,role="execute"]
----
oc patch OCSInitialization ocsinit -n openshift-storage --type json --patch  '[{ "op": "replace", "path": "/spec/enableCephTools", "value": true }]'
----

Or you can edit the `OCSInitialization ocsinit` to toggle the `enableCephTools` parameter to *true* using the following command line:

[source,role="execute"]
----
oc edit OCSInitialization ocsinit
----

The `spec` item must be set to the following value:

[source,role="execute"]
----
spec:
  enableCephTools: true
----

[IMPORTANT]
====
Toggling the value from `true` to `false` will terminate any running *toolbox* pod immediately.
====

After the `rook-ceph-tools` *Pod* is `Running` you can access the toolbox like this:

[source,role="execute"]
----
TOOLS_POD=$(oc get pods -n openshift-storage -l app=rook-ceph-tools -o name)
oc rsh -n openshift-storage $TOOLS_POD
----

Once inside the toolbox, try out the following Ceph commands to see the status of Ceph, the total number of OSDs (example below shows six after expanding storage), and the total amount of storage available in the cluster.

ceph status
