== Lab Overview

This hands-on workshop is for both system administrators and application developers interested in learning how to deploy and manage OpenShift Container Storage (OCS). In this lab you will be using OpenShift Container Platform (OCP) 4.x and the OCS operator to deploy Ceph and the Multi-Cloud-Gateway (MCG) as a persistent storage solution for OCP workloads. This instruction was developed using the RHPDS `OpenShift 4.2 Workshop`.

=== In this lab you will learn how to

* Configure and deploy containerized Ceph and NooBaa
* Validate deployment of containerized Ceph Nautilus and NooBaa
* Deploy the Rook toolbox to run Ceph and RADOS commands
* Creating a Read-Write-Once (RWO) PVC that is based on Ceph RBDs
* Creating a Read-Write-Many (RWX) PVC that is based on CephFS
* Using the MCG to create a bucket
* Add more storage to the Ceph cluster
* Use must-gather to collect support information

== Deploy your storage backend using the OCS operator

=== Scale OCP cluster and add 3 new nodes

In this section, you will first validate the OCP environment has 3 master and 2 worker nodes (or 3 worker nodes) before increasing the cluster size by additional 3 worker nodes for OCS resources. The `NAME` of your OCP nodes will be different than shown below.

Now you are going to add 3 more OCP compute nodes to cluster using *machinesets*.

[source,role="execute"]
----
oc get machinesets -n openshift-machine-api
----

This will show you the existing *machinesets* used to create the 3 worker nodes in the cluster already. There is a *machineset* for each AWS AZ (us-east-1a, us-east-1b, us-east-1c). Your *machinesets* `NAME` will be different than below.

Check that you have new *machines* created.

[source,role="execute"]
----
oc get machines -n openshift-machine-api
----

They may be in `pending` for sometime so repeat command above until they are in a `running` STATE. The `NAME` of your machines will be different than shown below.

----

You can see that the workerocs *machines* are using are also using the AWS EC2 instance type `m4.4xlarge`. The `m4.4xlarge` instance type follows our recommended instance sizing for OCS, 16 cpu and 64 GB mem.

Now you want to see if our new *machines* are added to the OCP cluster.

This step could take more than 5 minutes. The result of this command needs to look like below before you proceed. All new workerocs *machinesets* should have an integer, in this case `1`, filled out for all rows and under columns `READY` and `AVAILABLE`. The `NAME` of your *machinesets* will be different than shown below.

=== Installing the OCS operator

In this section you will be using three of the worker OCP nodes to deploy OCS 4. For this you will be using a manifest file, which adds multiple items to your OCP cluster as shown below. Using the manifest for deployment is temporary until OCS 4.2 is generally available (GA). At that time OCS 4 will be installed from OperatorHub in OCP 4 instead of using this manifest for installation of the following:

- The `openshift-storage` namespace
- The `local-storage` namespace
- Operator groups and sources for the OCS and local-storage operators
- An OCS subscription

To apply this manifest, execute the following:

[source,role="execute"]
----
oc apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openshift/ocs-operator/release-4.2/deploy/deploy-with-olm.yaml
----

This will fetch the manifest from the `release-4.2` tag. After applying this, you should be able to watch your new operators being installed.

[source,role="execute"]
----
watch oc -n openshift-storage get csv
----
.Example output:
----
NAME                            DISPLAY                                VERSION   REPLACES   PHASE
local-storage-operator.v4.2.0   Local Storage                          4.2.0                Installing
ocs-operator.v0.0.1             Openshift Container Storage Operator   0.0.1                InstallReady
----

You can exit by pressing kbd:[Ctrl+C]

The resource `csv` is a shortened word for `clusterserviceversions.operators.coreos.com`.

.Please wait until the operator `PHASE` changes to `Succeeded`
CAUTION: This will mark that the installation of your operators was successful. Reaching this state can take several minutes.

You will now also see some new operator pods in the new `openshift-storage` namespace:

[source,role="execute"]
----
oc -n openshift-storage get pods
----
.Example output:
----
NAME                                     READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
local-storage-operator-bcfd5765f-7bd86   1/1     Running   0          3m33s
noobaa-operator-7c55776bf9-kbcjp         1/1     Running   0          3m16s
ocs-operator-967957d84-9lc76             1/1     Running   0          3m16s
rook-ceph-operator-8444cfdc4c-9jm8p      1/1     Running   0          3m16s
----

Now switch over to your *Openshift Web Console* for the remainder of the installation for OCS 4. You can get your URL by issuing command below to get the OCP 4 `console` route. Put this URL in a browser tab. You will use the same Admin username and password you used to login and use the `oc client` to login to the OCP 4 `console`.

[source,role="execute"]
----
oc get -n openshift-console route console
----

Once you are logged in, navigate to the `Operators` menu on the left and select `Installed Operators`. Make sure the selected project is set to `openshift-storage`.
What you see, should be similar to the following example picture:

.Installed operators:  1) Make sure you are in the right project; 2) Check Operator status; 3) Click on Openshift Container Storage Operator
image::imgs/OCP-installed-operators.jpg[Openshift showing the installed operators in namespace openshift-storage]

Click on `Openshift Container Storage Operator` to get to the OCS configuration screen.

.OCS configuration screen
image::imgs/OCS-config-screen-all.png[OCS configuration screen]

On the top of the OCS configuration screen, scroll over to `Storage cluster` and click on `Create Instance`.

.OCS Create Storage Cluster
image::imgs/OCS-config-screen-storage-cluster.png[OCS Create Storage Cluster]

A dialog box will come up next.

.OCS create a new storage cluster
image::imgs/OCS-config-screen-new.png[OCS create a new storage cluster]

To select the OCP 4 nodes that you created earlier in the lab specifically for OCS, you can find them by searching for `role=storage-node` because this label was configured in the workerocs machinesets. It would be a good practice to add a unique label to OCP nodes (i.e., role=storage-node) that are to be used for creating the `Storage Cluster` prior to this step so they are easy to find in list of OCP nodes.

[source,role="execute"]
----
oc get nodes --show-labels | grep storage-node |cut -d' ' -f1
----

In this dialog, select these three nodes that have the role `storage-node` and `worker` and click on the button `Create` below the dialog box.

CAUTION: Make sure to select three workers in different availability zones.

In the background this will start initiating a lot of new pods in the `openshift-storage` namespace, as can be seen on the CLI:

----
oc -n openshift-storage get pods

### Getting to know the Storage Dashboards

You can now also check the status of your storage cluster with the OCS specific *Dashboards* that are included in your *Openshift Web Console*. You can reach this by clicking on `Home` on your left navigation bar, then selecting `Dashboards` and finally clicking on `Persistent Storage` on the top navigation bar of the content page.

.OCS Dashboard after successful backing storage installation
image::imgs/OCS-dashboard-healthy.png[OCS Dashboard after successful backing storage installation]

[cols="0,1,10a"]
|===
|<1> | Health | Quick overview of the general health of the storage cluster
|<2> | Details | Overview of the deployed storage cluster version and backend provider
|<3> | Inventory | List of all the resources that are used and offered by the storage system
|<4> | Events | Live overview of all the changes that are being done affecting the storage cluster
|<5> | Utilization | Overview of the storage cluster usage and performance
|===

OCS ships with a *Dashboard* for the Object Store service as well. From within the *Dashboard* menu click on the `Object Service` on the top navigation bar of the content page.

.OCS Multi-Cloud-Gateway Dashboard after successful installation
image::imgs/OCS-noobaa-dashboard-healthy.png[OCS Multi-Cloud-Gateway Dashboard after successful installation]

[cols="0,1,10a"]
|===
|<1> | Health | Quick overview of the general health of the Multi-Cloud-Gateway
|<2> | Details | Overview of the deployed MCG version and backend provider including a link to the MCG Dashboard
|<3> | Buckets | List of all the ObjectBucket with are offered and ObjectBucketClaims which are connected to them
|<4> | Resource Providers | Shows the list of configured Resource Providers that are available as backing storage in the MCG
|===

// On the left side of this *Dashboard* you see a blue link labelled `noobaa`, which will get you to the NooBaa Management Console. We will discuss this Management Console later in more detail.

Once this is all healthy, you will be able to use the three new `StorageClasses` created during the OCS 4 Install:

- ocs-storagecluster-ceph-rbd
- ocs-storagecluster-cephfs
- openshift-storage.noobaa.io

You can see these three `StorageClasses` from the Openshift Web Console by expanding the `Storage` menu in the left navigation bar and selecting `Storage Classes`. You can also run the command below:

[source,role="execute"]
----
oc -n openshift-storage get sc
----

Please make sure the three storage classes are available in your cluster before proceeding.

NOTE: The NooBaa pod used the `ocs-storagecluster-ceph-rbd` storage class for creating a PVC for mounting to it's `db` container.

=== Using the Rook-Ceph toolbox to check on the Ceph backing storage

Since the Rook-Ceph *toolbox* is not shipped with OCS, we need to deploy it manually. For this, we can leverage the upstream `toolbox.yaml` file, but we need to modify the namespace as shown below.

[source,role="execute"]
----
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rook/rook/release-1.1/cluster/examples/kubernetes/ceph/toolbox.yaml | sed 's/namespace: rook-ceph/namespace: openshift-storage/g'| oc apply -f -
----

After the `rook-ceph-tools` *Pod* is `Running` you can access the toolbox like this:

[source,role="execute"]
----
TOOLS_POD=$(oc get pods -n openshift-storage -l app=rook-ceph-tools -o name)
oc rsh -n openshift-storage $TOOLS_POD
----

Once inside the toolbox, try out the following Ceph commands:

[source,role="execute"]
----
ceph status
ceph osd status
ceph osd tree
ceph df
rados df
ceph versions
----
.Example output:
[source]
----
sh-4.2# ceph status
  cluster:
    id:     ce04255f-ca4c-499f-8819-58fb38095105
    health: HEALTH_OK

  services:
    mon: 3 daemons, quorum a,b,c (age 43m)
    mgr: a(active, since 42m)
    mds: ocs-storagecluster-cephfilesystem:1 {0=ocs-storagecluster-cephfilesystem-a=up:active} 1 up:standby-replay
    osd: 3 osds: 3 up (since 41m), 3 in (since 41m)
    rgw: 1 daemon active (ocs.storagecluster.cephobjectstore.a)

  task status:

    objects: 326 objects, 80 MiB
    usage:   3.1 GiB used, 3.0 TiB / 3.0 TiB avail
    pgs:     80 active+clean

  io:
    client:   938 B/s rd, 6.8 KiB/s wr, 1 op/s rd, 0 op/s wr
----

You can exit the toolbox by either pressing kbd:[Ctrl+D] or by executing `exit`.

=== Change the default storage class to Ceph RBD

After installing OCS, it is best practice to change the default *storage class* from AWS gp2 to our new OCS-backed storage class `ocs-storagecluster-ceph-rbd`.
The easiest way to do this is using the *Openshift Web Console*. In the Console expand the `Storage` item on the left navigation bar and select `Storage Classes`.

.OCP storage classes after OCS installation - AWS gp2 is the default storage class
image::imgs/OCS-Storage-Classes-gp2-default.png[]

Now click on the three dots next to the gp2 *storage class* and select `Edit Annotations`:

image::imgs/OCS-edit-gp2-annotations.png[]

Click on the stop sign on the right to delete the only entry, `storageclass.kubernetes.io/is-default-class`. Proceed by clicking on `Save`.

Now click on the three dots next to the ocs-storagecluster-ceph-rbd *storage class* and select `Edit Annotations`
In the new window enter `storageclass.kubernetes.io/is-default-class` as the Key and `true` as the value of the new annotation. Proceed by clicking on `Save`.

Now the `ocs-storagecluster-ceph-rbd` *storage class* should be marked as default, as shown below:

.After changing default storage class to Ceph RBD
image::imgs/OCS-Storage-Classes-rbd-default.png[]

== Create a new OCP application deployment using Ceph RBD volume

In this section the `ocs-storagecluster-ceph-rbd` *storage class* will be used by an OCP application + database *deployment* to create RWO (ReadWriteOnce) persistent storage. The persistent storage will be a Ceph RBD (RADOS Block Device) volume (object) in the Ceph pool `ocs-storagecluster-cephblockpool`.

Make sure that you completed all previous sections so that you are ready to start the Rails + PostgreSQL deployment.

[source,role="execute"]
----
oc new-project my-database-app
oc new-app rails-pgsql-persistent -p VOLUME_CAPACITY=5Gi
----

After the deployment is started you can monitor with these commands.

[source,role="execute"]
----
oc status
oc get pvc -n my-database-app
----

This step could take 5 or more minutes. Wait until there are 2 *Pods* in `Running` STATUS and 4 *Pods* in `Completed` STATUS as shown below.

[source,role="execute"]
----
watch oc get pods -n my-database-app
----
.Example output:
----
NAME                                READY   STATUS      RESTARTS   AGE
postgresql-1-deploy                 0/1     Completed   0          5m48s
postgresql-1-lf7qt                  1/1     Running     0          5m40s
rails-pgsql-persistent-1-build      0/1     Completed   0          5m49s
rails-pgsql-persistent-1-deploy     0/1     Completed   0          3m36s
rails-pgsql-persistent-1-hook-pre   0/1     Completed   0          3m28s
rails-pgsql-persistent-1-pjh6q      1/1     Running     0          3m14s
----

You can exit by pressing kbd:[Ctrl+C]

Once the deployment is complete you can now test the application and the persistent storage on Ceph. Your `HOST/PORT` will be different.

[source,role="execute"]
----
oc get route -n my-database-app
----
.Example output:
----
NAME                     HOST/PORT                                                                         PATH   SERVICES                 PORT    TERMINATION   WILDCARD
rails-pgsql-persistent   rails-pgsql-persistent-my-database-app.apps.cluster-a26e.sandbox449.opentlc.com          rails-pgsql-persistent
----

Copy your `rails-pgsql-persistent` route (different than above) to a browser window to create articles. You will need to append `/articles` to the end.

*Example*  http://<your_route>/articles

Enter the `username` and `password` below to create articles and comments. The articles and comments are saved in a PostgreSQL database which stores its table spaces on the Ceph RBD volume provisioned using the `ocs-storagecluster-ceph-rbd` *storageclass* during the application deployment.

[source,ini]
----
username: openshift
password: secret
----

Lets now take another look at the Ceph `ocs-storagecluster-cephblockpool` created by the `ocs-storagecluster-ceph-rbd` *Storage Class*. Log into the *toolbox* pod again.

[source,role="execute"]
----
TOOLS_POD=$(oc get pods -n openshift-storage -l app=rook-ceph-tools -o name)
oc rsh -n openshift-storage $TOOLS_POD
----

Run the same Ceph commands as before the application deployment and compare to results in prior section. Notice the number of objects in `ocs-storagecluster-cephblockpool` has increased. The third command lists RBDs and we should now have two RBDs.

[source,role="execute"]
----
ceph df
rados df
rbd -p ocs-storagecluster-cephblockpool ls | grep vol
----

You can exit the toolbox by either pressing kbd:[Ctrl+D] or by executing `exit`.

=== Matching PVs to RBDs

A handy way to match persistent volumes to Ceph RBDs is to execute:

[source,role="execute"]
----
oc get pv -o 'custom-columns=NAME:.spec.claimRef.name,PVNAME:.metadata.name,STORAGECLASS:.spec.storageClassName,VOLUMEHANDLE:.spec.csi.volumeHandle'
----
.Example output:
----
NAME                      PVNAME                                     STORAGECLASS                  VOLUMEHANDLE
ocs-deviceset-0-0-z2xzg   pvc-1b636a3f-f978-11e9-9bdd-005056818b15   thin                          <none>
ocs-deviceset-1-0-wcrql   pvc-1b64c8e5-f978-11e9-9bdd-005056818b15   thin                          <none>
ocs-deviceset-2-0-b82nr   pvc-1b6618fa-f978-11e9-9bdd-005056818b15   thin                          <none>
postgresql                pvc-3967abba-fbcd-11e9-9bdd-005056818b15   ocs-storagecluster-ceph-rbd   0001-0011-openshift-storage-0000000000000001-39787034-fbcd-11e9-8be1-0a580a810213

rook-ceph-mon-a           pvc-c434ab90-f977-11e9-9bdd-005056818b15   thin                          <none>
rook-ceph-mon-b           pvc-c74f9f10-f977-11e9-9bdd-005056818b15   thin                          <none>

----

The second half of the `VOLUMEHANDLE` column mostly matches what your RBD is named inside of Ceph. All you have to do is append `csi-vol-` to the front like this:

.Get the full RBD name of our postgreSQL PV in one command
[source,role="execute"]
----
oc get pv pvc-3967abba-fbcd-11e9-9bdd-005056818b15 -o jsonpath='{.spec.csi.volumeHandle}' | cut -d '-' -f 6- | awk '{print "csi-vol-"$1}'
----
.Example output:
----
csi-vol-39787034-fbcd-11e9-8be1-0a580a810213
----

[NOTE]
====
It is important to use the `PVNAME` in the above command
====

Now we can check on the details of our RBD from inside of the tools pod:

[source,role="execute"]
----
TOOLS_POD=$(oc get pods -n openshift-storage -l app=rook-ceph-tools -o name)

oc rsh -n openshift-storage $TOOLS_POD rbd -p ocs-storagecluster-cephblockpool info csi-vol-39787034-fbcd-11e9-8be1-0a580a810213
----
.Example output:
----

        modify_timestamp: Thu Oct 31 10:57:27 2019
----

[NOTE]
====
You will need to adjust the command to fit to your RBD name
====

== Create a new OCP application deployment using CephFS volume

In this section the `ocs-storagecluster-cephfs` *Storage Class* will be used to create a RWX (ReadWriteMany) PVC that can be used by multiple pods at the same time. The application we will use is called `File Uploader`.

Create a new project:

[source,role="execute"]
----
oc new-project my-shared-storage
----

Next deploy the example PHP application called `file-uploader`:

[source,role="execute"]
----
oc new-app openshift/php:7.1~https://github.com/christianh814/openshift-php-upload-demo --name=file-uploader
----

.Sample Output
----

    Apache 2.4 with PHP 7.1
    -----------------------
    PHP 7.1 available as container is a base platform for building and running various PHP 7.1 applications and frameworks. PHP is an HTML-embedded scripting language. PHP attempts to make it easy for developers to write dynamically generated web pages. PHP also offers built-in database integration for several commercial and non-commercial database management systems, so writing a database-enabled webpage with PHP is fairly simple. The most common use of PHP coding is probably as a replacement for CGI scripts.

    Tags: builder, php, php71, rh-php71

----

The command prompt returns out of the tail mode once you see _Push successful_.

[NOTE]
====
This use of the `new-app` command directly asked for application code to be
built and did not involve a template. That's why it only created a *single
Pod* deployment with a *Service* and no *Route*.
====

Let's make our application production ready by exposing it via a `Route` and scale to 3 instances for high availability:

[source,role="execute"]
----
oc expose svc/file-uploader -n my-shared-storage
oc scale --replicas=3 dc/file-uploader -n my-shared-storage
oc get pods -n my-shared-storage
----

You should have 3 `file-uploader` *Pods* in a few minutes.

[CAUTION]
====
Never attempt to store persistent data in a *Pod* that has no persistent
volume associated with it. *Pods* and their containers are ephemeral by
definition, and any stored data will be lost as soon as the *Pod* terminates
for whatever reason.
====

The app is of course not useful like this. We can fix this by providing shared
storage to this app.

You can create a *PersistentVolumeClaim* and attach it into an application with
the `oc set volume` command. Execute the following

[source,role="execute"]
----
oc set volume dc/file-uploader --add --name=my-shared-storage \
-t pvc --claim-mode=ReadWriteMany --claim-size=1Gi \
--claim-name=my-shared-storage --claim-class=ocs-storagecluster-cephfs \
--mount-path=/opt/app-root/src/uploaded \
-n my-shared-storage
----

This command will:

* create a *PersistentVolumeClaim*
* update the *DeploymentConfig* to include a `volume` definition
* update the *DeploymentConfig* to attach a `volumemount` into the specified
  `mount-path`
* cause a new deployment of the 3 application *Pods*

For more information on what `oc set volume` is capable of, look at its help output
with `oc set volume -h`. Now, let's look at the result of adding the volume:

[source,role="execute"]
----
oc get pvc -n my-shared-storage
----

.Sample Output
----
NAME                STATUS   VOLUME                                     CAPACITY   ACCESS MODES   STORAGECLASS                AGE
my-shared-storage   Bound    pvc-371c2184-fb73-11e9-b901-0aad1a53052d   1Gi        RWX            ocs-storagecluster-cephfs   47s
----

Notice the `ACCESSMODE` being set to *RWX* (short for `ReadWriteMany`).

All 3 `file-uploader`*Pods* are using the sane *RWX* volume. Without this `ACCESSMODE`, OpenShift will not attempt to attach multiple *Pods* to the same *PersistentVolume*
reliably. If you attempt to scale up deployments that are using *RWO* or `ReadWriteOnce` storage, the *Pods* will actually all become co-located on the same
node.

Try it out in your file uploader web application using your browser. Upload
new files.

Now, check the *Route* that has been created:

[source,role="execute"]
----
oc get route file-uploader -n my-shared-storage -o jsonpath --template="{.spec.host}"
----

This will return a route similar to this one (careful: there is no line break at the end so your shell prompt appears right after the output).

.Sample Output
----
file-uploader-my-shared-storage.apps.cluster-ocs-9b06.ocs-9b06.example.opentlc.com
----

Point your browser to the web application using the URL advertised by your route. *Your `route` will be different*

The web app simply lists all uploaded files and offers the ability to upload new ones as well as download the existing data. Right now there is

== Create a new OCP registry using CephFS (Optional)

In this section the `ocs-storagecluster-cephfs` *Storage Class* will be used to create a RWX (ReadWriteMany) PVC that can be used by multiple pods at the same time. As an example we will be running a highly-available container image registry. The persistent storage will be based on a CephFS volume in the Ceph pool `ocs-storagecluster-cephfilesystem-data0`.

[CAUTION]
====
*This section requires either installing or downloading podman. The utility podman is known to not operator correctly with Mac OS.*
====

Deploy the registry like this:

[source,role="execute"]
----
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rook/rook/master/cluster/examples/kubernetes/ceph/csi/cephfs/kube-registry.yaml | sed 's/storageClassName: csi-cephfs/storageClassName: ocs-storagecluster-cephfs/g'| oc apply -f -
----

This will create a PVC in the `kube-system` namespace:

[source,role="execute"]
----
oc get -n kube-system pvc
----
.Example output:
----
NAME         STATUS   VOLUME                                     CAPACITY   ACCESS MODES   STORAGECLASS                AGE
cephfs-pvc   Bound    pvc-a7015af1-f0dd-11e9-8812-06aa2fd1035a   1Gi        RWX            ocs-storagecluster-cephfs   55s
----

As well as a deployment for our registry:

[source,role="execute"]
----
oc get -n kube-system deployment
----
.Example output:
----
NAME            READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
kube-registry   3/3     3            3           100s
----

.The `kube-registry` *deployment* consists of more than one replica
NOTE: Since our deployment consists of three containers, we need a RWX PVC, so that all replicas can access the persistent volume in parallel.

There are also 3 *Pods* sharing the same Ceph FS PVC for read/write operations.

[source,role="execute"]
----
oc get -n kube-system pods
----
.Example output:
----
$ oc get pods -n kube-system
NAME                             READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
kube-registry-5b9c9854c5-45w9m   1/1     Running   0          9m47s
kube-registry-5b9c9854c5-cjtqc   1/1     Running   0          9m47s
kube-registry-5b9c9854c5-jfpkl   1/1     Running   0          9m47s
----

Let's make our *deployment* accessible. First we create a service with an internal Cluster IP:

[source,role="execute"]
----
oc expose -n kube-system deployment kube-registry
----

Then we create a route with a edge termination so that it serves our registry with tls:

[source,role="execute"]
----
oc create route edge -n kube-system --service=kube-registry
----

There is now a route to get the URL for our new registry:

[source,role="execute"]
----
oc get -n kube-system route
----
.Example output:
----
NAME            HOST/PORT                                                                            PATH   SERVICES        PORT    TERMINATION   WILDCARD
kube-registry   kube-registry-kube-system.apps.cluster-berlin-fc41.berlin-fc41.example.opentlc.com          kube-registry   <all>   edge          None
----

To continue you will need to install Podman. Installation steps for various operating systems can be found here: https://github.com/containers/libpod/blob/master/install.md

For RHEL-based systems, it is as easy as:

[source,role="execute"]
----
sudo yum -y install podman
----

Now that podman is installed we can now download the alpine container image as an example and upload it to our new registry:

[source,role="execute"]
----
sudo podman pull docker.io/library/alpine
----

[source,role="edit"]
----
sudo podman push docker.io/library/alpine --tls-verify=false <KUBE_REGISTRY_ROUTE>/alpine
----
.Example command:
----
sudo podman push docker.io/library/alpine --tls-verify=false kube-registry-kube-system.apps.cluster-ocs-3ed9.ocs-3ed9.example.opentlc.com/alpine
----

CAUTION: Make sure to replace the URL in the push command with the URL of your route

Next we use the `toolbox` *Pod* to check on our underlying CephFS volume:

[source,role="execute"]
----
TOOLS_POD=$(oc get pods -n openshift-storage -l app=rook-ceph-tools -o name)
oc rsh -n openshift-storage $TOOLS_POD
----

These steps should be done in the `toolbox` pod.

----
# Create the directory
mkdir /tmp/registry

# Detect the mon endpoints and the user secret for the connection
mon_endpoints=$(grep mon_host /etc/ceph/ceph.conf | awk '{print $3}')
my_secret=$(grep key /etc/ceph/keyring | awk '{print $3}')

# Mount the file system
mount -t ceph -o mds_namespace=ocs-storagecluster-cephfilesystem,name=admin,secret=$my_secret $mon_endpoints:/ /tmp/registry

# See your mounted file system
df -h /tmp/registry

# Find our uploaded container image
ls /tmp/registry/volumes/csi/csi-vol-*/docker/registry/v2/repositories/alpine/
----

Once you finished these steps, you can see that we successfully mounted the *RWX PVC* inside of our toolbox *Pod*, while it is also still mounted on the registry *Pods*. The `ls` shows the content of the alpine folder, which should now show our uploaded alpine container image.
Changes to this filesystem is immediately affecting the registry *Pods* and this procedure is great to debug issues that your *Pods* have with persistent files.

== Using the Multi-Cloud-Gateway

This section discusses the usage of the Multi-Cloud-Gateway (MCG). It is expected that the installation of MCG has been finished successfully and the local `oc` client is configured correctly to connect to the Openshift cluster.
Currently the best way to configure the MCG is to use the CLI.

To install the CLI follow the <<Install the NooBaa CLI client>> section.

NOTE: While the NooBaa Web Management Console is accessible, it should not be used to create any resources, since they are currently not syncronised back to the Openshift cluster.

=== Checking on the MCG status

The MCG status can be checked with the NooBaa CLI. Make sure you are in the `openshift-storage` project when you execute this command.

[source,role="execute"]
----

----

As you can see - the NooBaa CLI will first check on the environment and will then print all the information about the environment.
Besides the status of the MCG, the second most intersting information for us are the available S3 addresses that we can use to connect to our MCG buckets. We can chose between using the external DNS which incurs DNS traffic cost, or route internally inside of our Openshift cluster.

You can get a more basic overview of the MCG status using the Object Storage *Dashboard*. To reach this, log into the *Openshift Web Console*, click on `Home` and select the `Dashboards` item. In the main view, select `Object Service` in the top navigation bar.
This dashboard does not give you connection information for your S3 endpoint, but offers Graphs and runtime information about the usage of your S3 backend.

=== Creating an Object Bucket Claim

An Object Bucket Claim (OBC) can be used to request a S3 compatible bucket backend for your workloads. When creating an OBC you get a ConfigMap (CM) and a Secret that together contain all the information your application needs to use the object storage service.

Creating an OBC is as simple as using the NooBaa CLI:

[source,role="execute"]
----
noobaa obc create test21obc -n openshift-storage
----
.Example output:
----
INFO[0001] ✅ Created: ObjectBucketClaim "test21obc"
----

The NooBaa CLI has created the necessary configuration inside of NooBaa and has informed Openshift about the new OBC:

[source,role="execute"]
----
oc get obc -n openshift-storage
----
.Example output:
----

As you can see, the secret gives us the S3 access credentials, while the CM contains the S3 endpoint information for our application.

== Adding storage to the Ceph Cluster

Adding storage to OCS adds capacity and performance to your already present cluster.

[NOTE]
====
For this you can select to either add more storage worker nodes, or leverage the already present nodes to add more storage capacity.
The reason for adding more OCP worker nodes for storage is because the existing nodes do not have adequate CPU and/or Memory available.
====

=== Add storage worker nodes

This section will explain how one can add more worker nodes to the present storage cluster. Afterwards follow the next sub-section on how to extend the OCS cluster to provision storage on these new nodes.

To add more nodes, we could either add more machinesets like we did before, or scale the already present OCS machinesets. For this training, we will spawn more workers by scaling the already present OCS worker instances up:

.Check on our present machinesets
[source,role="execute"]
----

----

Let's scale the workerocs machinesets up with this command:

[source,role="execute"]
----
oc get machinesets -n openshift-machine-api -o name | grep workerocs | xargs -n1 -t oc scale -n openshift-machine-api --replicas=2

machineset.machine.openshift.io/cluster-ocs-89db-brbwq-workerocs-us-east-1c scaled
----

Wait until the new workers are available.
[source,role="execute"]
----
watch oc get machinesets -n openshift-machine-api

Once they are available, we can check on their labels like this:

[source,role="execute"]
----
oc get nodes -o json | jq '.items[] | select(.metadata.labels.role == "storage-node") | .metadata.name,.metadata.labels'

We can see that there are three new nodes, which do not yet have the `cluster.ocs.openshift.io/openshift-storage` label applied yet. We will apply this now:

----

We get errors for the nodes which already had the label applied, which is fine.
Now we have the new instances prepared for extending the cluster, proceed to the next chapter to provision storage on these empty instances, the OCS operator will pick prefer the empty instances for new storage.

=== Add storage capacity

In this section we will add storage capacity and performance to the configured OCS worker nodes. If you have followed the previous section you should now have 6 OCS nodes, otherwise you have three worker nodes, which is fine too.

To add storage, go to the Openshift Web Console and follow the steps to reach the OCS storage cluster overview:

 - Click on `Operators` on the left navigation bar
 - Select `Installed Operators`
 - Click on `Openshift Container Storage Operator`
 - In the top navigation bar, scroll right to find the item `Storage Cluster` and click on it

image::imgs/OCS-Storage-Cluster-overview-reachit.png[]

 - The visible list should list only one item - click on the three dots on the far right to extend the options menu
 - Select `Add Capacity` from the options menu

.Add capacity dialog
image::imgs/OCS-add-capacity.png[]

In the new dialog you can set the requested additional (usable) capacity and the storage class. On AWS, the storage class should be set to `gp2`.

NOTE: The effectivly provisioned capacity will be three times as much as you put into the `Requested Capacity` field, because OCS uses a replica count of 3.

Once you are done with your setting, proceed by clicking on `Add`. You will see the Status of the Storage Cluster change until it reaches `Ready` again.


NOTE: Due to a bug in the current version, a new storage capacity won't be added. will be fixed soon


You can now see that there are new OSD pods and if you previously added new ndoes that they use the new OCS worker nodes:

This is everything that you need to do to extend the OCS storage.

=== Verify new storage

Once you added the capacity and made sure that the OSD pods are present, you can also optionally check the additional storage capacity using the Ceph tools. To do this, follow these steps:

.Enter the tools pod that you created in <<Using the Rook-Ceph toolbox to check on the Ceph backing storage,the previous section>>
[source,role="execute"]
----
TOOLS_POD=$(oc get pods -n openshift-storage -l app=rook-ceph-tools -o name)
oc rsh -n openshift-storage $TOOLS_POD
----

.Check the status of the Ceph cluster
[source,role="execute"]
----
ceph status
----
.Example output:
----
cluster:
id: aa6f29a9-8de3-4e41-963a-8adb0c5d8bee
health: HEALTH_OK

services:
mon: 3 daemons, quorum a,b,c (age 2h)
mgr: a(active, since 2h)
mds: ocs-storagecluster-cephfilesystem:1 {0=ocs-storagecluster-cephfilesystem-a=up:active} 1 up:standby-replay
osd: 6 osds: 6 up (since 73s), 6 in (since 73s) <1>
rgw: 1 daemon active (ocs.storagecluster.cephobjectstore.a)

data:
pools: 10 pools, 80 pgs
objects: 392 objects, 388 MiB
usage: 6.9 GiB used, 6.0 TiB / 6.0 TiB avail <2>
pgs: 80 active+clean

io:
client: 1.2 KiB/s rd, 46 KiB/s wr, 2 op/s rd, 4 op/s wr
----

In the Ceph status output, we can already see that:

<1> We now use 6 osds in total and they are `up` and `in` (meaning the deamons are running and being used to store data)
<2> The available raw capacity has increased from 3 TiB to 6 TiB

Besides that, nothing has changed in the output.

<1> We now have additional hosts, which are extending the hosts in the respective zone

Since our Ceph cluster's CRUSH rules are set up to replicate data between the zones, this is an effective way to relax the load on the previous nodes.

If you did not add more nodes and skipped the <<Add storage worker nodes>> section, then your output will be similar to this:

.Example output:
----
ID  CLASS WEIGHT  TYPE NAME
 -1       5.99396 root default

----

<1> These are the new OSDs that we added to the existing hosts

This is an effective way to scale out capacity and performance if you observe that your hosts are not exhausted, but you are running out of either capacity or IOPs.

In both scale-out cases, existing data on the old OSDs will be balanced out automatically, so that the old and the new OSDs share the load.

== Using must-gather

Must-gather is a tool for collecting data about the current'y running Openshift cluster. It loads a predefined set of containers that execute multiple programs and dump it on the local workstations filesystem.
The local files can then be used by a remote support engineer to debug a problem more easily without needing direct cluster access. This is similar to sosreports for RHEL hosts.

The OCS team has released its own image for the must-gather tool that runs storage specific commands.

You can run this diagnostic tool like this for generic Openshift debugging:

----
oc adm must-gather
----

Or like this for OCS specific insights:

----
oc adm must-gather --image=quay.io/ocs-dev/ocs-must-gather
----

The output will then be saved in the current directory inside of a new folder called `must-gather.local.(random)`

More runtime options can be displayed with

----
oc adm must-gather -h
----
.Example output:
----
Launch a pod to gather debugging information

 This command will launch a pod in a temporary namespace on your cluster that gathers debugging information and then
downloads the gathered information.

 Experimental: This command is under active development and may change without notice.

Usage:
  oc adm must-gather [flags]

Examples:
  # gather information using the default plug-in image and command, writing into ./must-gather.local.<rand>
  oc adm must-gather

  # gather information with a specific local folder to copy to
  oc adm must-gather --dest-dir=/local/directory

  # gather information using multiple plug-in images
  oc adm must-gather --image=quay.io/kubevirt/must-gather --image=quay.io/openshift/origin-must-gather

  # gather information using a specific image stream plug-in
  oc adm must-gather --image-stream=openshift/must-gather:latest

  # gather information using a specific image, command, and pod-dir
  oc adm must-gather --image=my/image:tag --source-dir=/pod/directory -- myspecial-command.sh

Options:
      --dest-dir='': Set a specific directory on the local machine to write gathered data to.
      --image=[]: Specify a must-gather plugin image to run. If not specified, OpenShift's default must-gather image
will be used.
      --image-stream=[]: Specify an image stream (namespace/name:tag) containing a must-gather plugin image to run.
      --node-name='': Set a specific node to use - by default a random master will be used
      --source-dir='/must-gather/': Set the specific directory on the pod copy the gathered data from.

Use "oc adm options" for a list of global command-line options (applies to all commands).
----

// On the Openshift side must-gather has nowadays been replaced by `oc adm inspect`.

[appendix]
== Configuring the local oc client

This section will explain how you set up your workstation with the Openshift CLI.

To get the latest OpenShift CLI client run the following commands:


.Mac steps
[source]
----
wget https://mirror.openshift.com/pub/openshift-v4/clients/ocp/latest/ --no-directories --accept="*client-mac*" --quiet --recursive --level=1
ls -1 openshift-client-mac-*.tar.gz | tail -n1 | xargs -I {} tar xzvf {} oc
sudo mv oc /usr/local/bin
----

In addition install the watch command to use with the `oc client` on your Mac using Homebrew.

----
brew install watch
----
Alternatively, add the following lines to your $HOME/.profile.

----
function watch {
while :; do clear; date; echo; $@; sleep 2; done
}
----

Then reload your profile with `source $HOME/.profile`.

.Linux steps
[source]
----
wget https://mirror.openshift.com/pub/openshift-v4/clients/ocp/latest/ --no-directories --accept="*client-linux*" --quiet --recursive --level=1
ls -1 openshift-client-linux-*.tar.gz | tail -n1 | xargs -I {} tar xzvf {} oc
sudo mv oc /usr/bin
----

Afterwards, go to your Openshift Web Console, log in and click on the username in the top right corner. There you will find the menu item `Copy Login Command`.

.Copy Login command menu entry
image::imgs/OCP-copy-login-command.png[]

Clicking on `Copy Login Command` will open a new window and you might be required to login to your Openshift cluster again.
After successfully login in, you see blue text `Display token` - click this and you will be shown your login command.

The login command will look similar to this

`oc login --token=zoNoANLOOoJzXV3sb-TE1xIcg2aLBssdN0bTNIuV29w --server=https://api.cluster-ocs-89db.ocs-89db.example.opentlc.com:6443`

execute this login command on your terminal. If you did not provision your RHPDS environment with Let's Encrypt certificates, it will ask if you want to connect without certificate checks, accept this.

Check if you are successfully connected by issuing a command against the cluster:

[source,role="execute"]
----
oc version
----
.Example output:
----
Client Version: openshift-clients-4.2.0-201910041700
Server Version: 4.2.0
Kubernetes Version: v1.14.6+2e5ed54
----

[NOTE]
====
The above commands will always pull the latest oc version, so your version might be higher than the version in the example output.
====

[appendix]
== Install the NooBaa CLI client

To install the CLI, follow these steps on your workstation:

.Mac steps
[source]
----
brew install noobaa/noobaa/noobaa
----
.Mac steps without Homebrew
[source]
----
curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/noobaa/noobaa-operator/releases/latest | grep "mac" | cut -d : -f 2,3 | tr -d \" | wget -qi - ; mv noobaa-mac-* noobaa ; chmod +x noobaa; sudo mv noobaa /usr/local/bin/
----

.Linux steps

== Ceph 101 - Introduction to Ceph

This section will go through some Ceph fundamental knowledge for a better understanding of the underlying storage solution
underneath OCS 4.

.*Timeline*
The Ceph project has a long history behind it and is not as young as ones may think.

.Ceph Project History

It is a battle-tested software defined storage solution that has been available as a storage backend with Openstack and Kubernetes for quite some time.

.*Architecture*
The Ceph cluster provides a scalable storage solution while providing multiple access methods to enable the different types of
clients present within the IT infrastructure to get access to the data.

.Ceph Architecture

The entire Ceph architecture is resilient and does not present any single point of failure (SPOF).

RADOS

The heart of Ceph is an object store known as RADOS (Reliable Autonomic Distributed Object Store) bottom layer on the screen. This
layer provides the Ceph software defined storage with the ability to store data (serve IO requests, to protect the data, to check
the consistency and the integrity of the data through built-in mechanisms. The RADOS layer is composed of the following daemons:

<1> MONs or Monitors
<2> OSDs or Object Storage Devices
<3> MGRs or Managers
<4> MDSs or Meta Data Servers

.Monitors
The Monitors maintain the cluster map and state and provide distributed decision-making while configured in an odd number, 3 or 5 depending
on the size and the topology of the cluster, to prevent split-brain situations. The Monitors are not in the data-path and do not serve IO
requests to and from the clients.

.OSDs
One OSD is typically deployed for each local block devices and the native scalable nature of Ceph allows for tghousands of OSDs to be part of the cluster.
The OSDs are serving IO requests from the clients while guaranteeing the protection of the data (replication or erasure coding), the rebalancing of the data
in case of an OSD or a node failure, the coherence of the data (scrubbing and deep-scrubbing of the existing data).

.MGRs
The Managers are tightly integrated with the Monitors and collect the statistics within the cluster. Additionally they provide an extensible framework for the
cluster through a pluggable Python interface aimed at expanding the Ceph existing capabilities. The current list of modules developed around the Manager framework
are:

* Balancer module
* Placement Group auto-scaler module
* Dashboard module
* RESTful module
* Prometheus module
* Zabbix module
* Rook module

.MDSs
The Meta Data Servers manage the metadata for the POSIX compliant shared filesystem such as the directory hierarchy and the file metadata (ownership, timestamps, mode, ...).
All the metadata is stored with RADOS and they do not server any data to the clients. MDSs are only deployed when a shared filesystem is configured in the Ceph cluster.
To avoid

If we look at the Ceph cluster foundation layer, the full picture with the different types of daemons or containers looks like this.

.*Access Methods*
Ceph was designed to provides the IT environment with all the necessary access methods so that any application can use what is the best solution for its use-case.

.*Librados*
Librados allows developers to code natively against the native Ceph cluster API for maximum efficiency combined with a small footprint. The Ceph native
API offers different wrappers such as C, C++, Python, Java, Ruby, Erlang, Go and Rust.

==== RADOS Block Device (RBD)
This access method is used in Red Hat Enterprise Linux or Openshift 3 and 4. This mode currently does not allow leveraging the
RBD Mirroring feature. RBD are typically used for RWO claims in OCP3 and 4.

.Kernel Module (kRBD)
This access method is used in Red Hat Openstack Environment or in Openshift through the RBD-NBD driver when it lands in RHEL 8.1 kernel.
This mode will allow us to leverage RBD Mirroring in future version. RBD are typically used for RWO claims in OCP3 and 4

.kRBD Diagram

.Userspace RBD (librbd)
This method allows clients to jointly access a shared POSIX compliant filesystem. The client initally contacts the Meta Data Server to obtain
the location of the object(s) for a given inode and then communicates directly with an OSD to perform the final IO request. CephFS is typically
used for RWX claims but can also be used to support RWO claims.

==== Shared Filesystem (CephFS)
This access method offers support for the Amazon S3 and Openstack Swift support on top of a Ceph cluster. The Openshift Conatiner Storage MultiCloud
Gateway can leverage the RADOS to support Object Bucket Claims.

.Object Storage (S3 and Swift Support)
The Ceph cluster being a distributed architecture, some solution had to be designed to provide an efficient way to distribute the data across the multiple
OSDs in the cluster. The technique used is called CRUSH or Controlled Replication Under Scalable Hashing. With CRUSH, every object is assigned to one
and only one hash bucket know as a Placement Group (aka PG).

=== CRUSH
CRUSH is the central point of configuration for the topolgy of the cluster. It offers a pseudo-random placement algorithm to distribute the objects across
the PGs and uses rules to determine the mapping of the PGs to the OSDs. In essence, the PGs are an abstraction layer between the objects (application layer)
and the OSDs (physical layer). In case of failure, the PG will be remapped to a different physical devices (OSD) and eventually see its content resynchronized
to match the protection rules  selected by the storage administrator.

.Ceph Data Placement

=== Cluster Partitioning
The Ceph OSDs will be in charge of the protection of the data as well as the constant checking of the integrity of the data stored in the entire cluster.
The cluster will be separated into logical partitions, knwown as a pool. Each pool has the following properties that can be adjusted:

<1> Each pool has a name
<2> A number of PGs to distribute the objects across the OSDs
<3> A CRUSH rule to determine the mapping of the PGs for this pool
<4> A type of protection (Replication or Erasure Coding)
<5> The parameters associated with the type of protection
<6> Various flags to influence the behaviour of the cluster

=== Pools and PGs

=== Data Protection
Ceph supports two types of data protection presented in the diagram below.

.Ceph Data Protection
image::imgs/ceph101-dataprotection.png[Replicated Pools vs Erasure Coded Pools,align="center"]

=== Data Distribution
To leverage the Ceph architecture at its best, all access methods but librados, will access the data in the cluster through a collection of objects. Hence a 1GB
block device will be a collection of objects, each supporting a set of device sectors, a 1GB file stored in a CephFS directory will be split in multiple objects,
a 5GB S3 object stored through the RADOS Gateway via the MultiCloud Gateway will be divided in multiple objects.

Out of the box, each access method uses an object size of 4MB. As an example, the following schematic shows how a 32MB RBD (Block Device) supporting a RWO PVC will
actually be scattered throughout the cluster.
